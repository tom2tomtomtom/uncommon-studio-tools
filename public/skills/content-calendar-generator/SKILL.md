## Tentpole Mapping

### Tentpole Categories

**Industry events**: Conferences, award ceremonies, product launches
**Cultural moments**: Holidays, awareness days, seasonal events
**Brand moments**: Anniversaries, milestones, campaign launches
**Reactive opportunities**: Anticipated news cycles, predictable trends

### Tentpole Planning Process

1. **Map fixed dates**: Non-negotiable moments (product launches, events)
2. **Layer industry tentpoles**: Relevant conferences, industry dates
3. **Add cultural moments**: Select only those with genuine brand relevance
4. **Identify gaps**: Periods needing original content focus
5. **Plan reactive capacity**: Leave room for real-time opportunities

### Tentpole Relevance Test

Before including a cultural moment:
- Does our audience care about this?
- Can we add genuine value or perspective?
- Does it connect authentically to our brand?
- Are we equipped to contribute meaningfully?

If not, skip it. Forced relevance damages credibility.

### Sustainability Check

Before finalising cadence:
- Do we have resources to maintain this?
- Is quality sustainable at this volume?
- What's the backup plan for low-capacity periods?

## Content Theming

### Monthly Theme Approach

Assign each month a strategic theme that:
- Connects to business priorities
- Resonates with audience interests
- Allows for content variety
- Builds narrative over time

Example: Q1 themes for a wellness brand
- January: "Fresh Starts" (New Year energy, habit building)
- February: "Self-Care Isn't Selfish" (Valentine's reframe)
- March: "Energy Reset" (Season change, daylight saving)

### Content Pillar Distribution

Define 3-5 content pillars and ensure balanced coverage:

Example pillars:
- Thought leadership (25%)
- Educational/helpful (30%)
- Behind-the-scenes/culture (20%)
- Product/service (15%)
- Community/engagement (10%)

Track pillar distribution weekly to avoid over-indexing on any single type.
