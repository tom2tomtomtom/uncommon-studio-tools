# RFP Red Flags: Warning Signs Checklist

Early identification saves pursuit time and protects agency resources. This enhanced checklist includes both traditional red flags AND strategic warning signs that indicate positioning risk.

---

## Part 1: Traditional Red Flags

### RFP Process Warning Signs
- **Compressed timeline** (<2 weeks for substantial response)
- **No Q&A session** offered or questions discouraged

- **Spec creative required** without compensation
- **No chemistry meeting** before final presentation

### RFP Content Warning Signs
- **Vague scope, specific budget** (fishing for free ideas)
- **Deliverable list without strategic context** (order-taking client)
- **Inconsistent requirements** (different sections contradict)
- **Excessive mandatory elements** that don't match stated goals
- **Copy-paste from previous RFPs** (lazy/disengaged process)

---

## Part 2: Client Behavior Red Flags

### Pre-RFP Warning Signs
- **Won't disclose how they found you** (may be padding numbers)
- **Resistance to preliminary conversation** before RFP release
- **Multiple procurement contacts** with conflicting information
- **Rush to get RFP out** without adequate preparation
- **Evasive about incumbent status** or relationship quality

### During-Process Warning Signs
- **Procurement-only contact** (no marketing stakeholder access)

- **Changing requirements** after RFP distribution
- **Adding agencies mid-process** (diluting focus)
- **Pressure tactics** for faster response or lower price
- **Dismissive of agency questions** or concerns

---

## Part 3: Competitive Red Flags

### Incumbent Advantage Signs
- **RFP language mirrors incumbent capabilities** exactly
- **Technical requirements match incumbent's stack**
- **Sudden review after long, stable relationship** (compliance pitch)
- **Very short timeline** (incumbent can repurpose existing work)
- **Incumbent invited to "competitive" pitch** already won informally

### Competitor-Favored Signs
- **Specific methodology requirements** named that others own
- **Platform certifications** only one agency has
- **Case study requirements** that exclude most competitors
- **Geographic requirements** that favor specific shops
- **Relationships visible** between prospect and competitor leadership

### Wired/Predetermined Signs
- **Extremely narrow scope** that only one agency can fill
- **Reference checks requested before pitch** (winner already selected)
- **Unusual evaluation criteria** that favor known vendor
- **Internal candidate competing** (in-house team option)
- **Board member with agency affiliation**

---

## Part 4: Strategic Red Flags (NEW)

These are warning signs that the opportunity, while legitimate, may position the agency badly or create relationship problems post-win.

### Brief Validity Red Flags

**Symptoms of wrong problem diagnosis:**
- **Vanity metrics as primary KPIs** (SOV, reach, impressions without business context)
- **Tactics requested without strategic rationale** (client knows what they want done, not why)
- **Objectives that won't solve stated problem** (asking for media coverage to fix a positioning issue)
- **Missing root cause analysis** (addressing symptoms rather than underlying dynamics)
- **Conflicting goals** that can't all be achieved simultaneously

**Symptoms of client identity crisis:**
- **Market leader requesting "challenger" positioning** (scale of legacy, spirit of disruptor)
- **Challenger claiming leader credentials** (overclaiming market position)
- **Inconsistent brand language** throughout RFP (unsure of own identity)
- **Multiple audiences without prioritization** (trying to be everything to everyone)
- **Defensive rather than offensive posture** (protecting position vs. advancing)

**Symptoms of strategic confusion:**
- **Requesting execution without strategy** (want campaigns, not thinking)
- **Multiple RFPs for overlapping scopes** (PR agency + content agency + social agency for same objectives)
- **Internal misalignment visible** (marketing says one thing, comms says another)
- **Recent strategic pivot mentioned without explanation** (unstable direction)
- **No mention of business strategy** that communications should support

### Positioning Risk Red Flags

**Signs you'll be positioned as vendor, not partner:**
- **Detailed deliverable lists with no strategic context**
- **Procurement-led process with no marketing access**
- **Budget discussion before strategy discussion**
- **Multiple agencies for same scope** (comparing execution, not thinking)
- **No interest in your strategic methodology**

**Signs the win would be hollow:**
- **Scope that won't produce notable work** (support role, not leadership)
- **Client unwilling to share data** needed for strategic work
- **Restricted access to decision-makers** post-win
- **Low visibility engagement** (behind-the-scenes support)
- **No expansion path visible** (dead-end assignment)

**Signs of future relationship problems:**
- **Unrealistic expectations in brief** (results no agency can deliver)
- **History of blaming agencies** for business problems
- **Micromanagement signals** (approval of every tactical decision)
- **Internal politics evident** (competing stakeholders, unclear authority)
- **Previous agency "failures"** that sound like client problems

### Response Quality Red Flags

**Signs your response is too safe:**
- **You've accepted the brief entirely at face value**
- **No uncomfortable recommendations included**
- **Response reads like capability catalogue, not strategic proposal**
- **Differentiating on credentials, not thinking**
- **Anyone on the pitch list could have written this response**

**Signs your response misses the point:**
- **Addressing stated problem when underlying problem is different**
- **Optimizing for wrong metrics**
- **Missing the competitive dynamic that actually matters**
- **Treating sophisticated client as unsophisticated** (or vice versa)
- **Answering "what we do" rather than "what you need"**

---

## Part 5: Industry-Specific Red Flags

### For PR Agencies
- **Guaranteed coverage requirements** (earned media isn't guaranteed)
- **AVE/impressions as primary metrics** (outdated measurement)
- **Crisis work without retainer commitment**
- **Political/controversial client without transparency**
- **Restricted media list** (client controls narrative too tightly)
- **"Dominate share of voice" without baseline** (unmeasurable goal)
- **Executive profiling without executive access** (can't deliver)
- **Thought leadership without thought** (no actual point of view)

### For Advertising/Creative Agencies
- **No brand guidelines or assets provided** (not ready to work)
- **"Make it viral" requirements** (unrealistic expectations)
- **Production included in creative budget** (scope compression)
- **Final creative approval by committee** (design by consensus)
- **"We'll know it when we see it" brief** (no clear success criteria)

### For Digital/Performance Agencies
- **Guaranteed ROI/CPA commitments** before learning period
- **No access to historical data** for benchmarking
- **Platform restrictions** (must use inferior tools)
- **Real-time reporting demands** beyond reasonable scope
- **Attribution model disagreements** not resolved upfront

---

## Part 6: Red Flag Response Matrix

### Proceed with Caution (document and mitigate)
- Minor timeline compression (negotiate extension)
- Budget not disclosed (probe in Q&A)
- Procurement-led but marketing accessible
- 1-2 minor contract concerns (negotiable)
- Brief partially valid (address gaps in response)

### Serious Concern (require resolution before GO)
- Spec creative request (propose paid tissue session)
- Multiple competing priorities signals
- Incumbent appears favored
- Payment terms beyond acceptable threshold
- Reputation concerns from 1-2 sources
- Brief validity significantly questionable

### Likely No-Go (strong justification needed)
- Open RFP with unknown respondent count
- IP ownership claim on submissions
- No Q&A and no chemistry meeting
- Multiple serious reputation warnings
- Requirements clearly favor competitor
- Brief solving wrong problem entirely

### Automatic No-Go (no exceptions)
- Spec creative with IP claim
- Payment terms >90 days without negotiation
- Known bad actor client (agency blacklist)
- Ethical concerns with client business
- Timeline physically impossible to meet

## Part 7: Documenting Red Flags

For each red flag identified:

```
FLAG: [Description]
CATEGORY: [Process / Content / Behavioral / Competitive / Strategic]
SEVERITY: [Minor / Moderate / Serious / Critical]
SOURCE: [RFP doc / Research / Network intel / Strategic analysis]
MITIGATION: [Can this be addressed? How?]
IMPACT ON QUALIFICATION: [Effect on go/no-go]
IMPACT ON POSITIONING: [Effect on how we should pursue]
```

### Strategic Flag Documentation (Additional)

For strategic red flags specifically:

```
STRATEGIC FLAG: [Description]
UNDERLYING DYNAMIC: [What this flag indicates about the client's situation]
RISK IF IGNORED: [What happens if we proceed without addressing]
OPPORTUNITY IF ADDRESSED: [What we gain by surfacing this in our response]
RECOMMENDED APPROACH: [How to handle in response/pitch]
```

---

## Part 8: The Meta-Question

After completing red flag analysis, ask:

**"If we win this exactly as briefed, will we be proud of the relationship in 12 months?"**

- If yes → proceed with standard approach
- If uncertain → address concerns in response/pitch
- If no → either reframe aggressively or decline

A clean RFP with no traditional red flags can still be a bad opportunity if winning means being positioned as an order-taker rather than a strategic partner.
