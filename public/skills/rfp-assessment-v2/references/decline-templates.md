## Template 1: Standard Decline (Capacity/Timing)

**Subject:** RE: [Client Name] RFP — Response from [Agency Name]

Dear [Contact Name],

Thank you for including [Agency Name] in the RFP process for [project/scope description]. We appreciate you thinking of us for this opportunity.

After careful review, we've determined that our current commitments won't allow us to deliver the caliber of response this opportunity deserves within the timeline. Rather than submit work that doesn't reflect our best thinking, we've made the difficult decision to respectfully decline.

We would welcome the opportunity to be considered for future projects when timing aligns better with our capacity. Please do keep us in mind.

Wishing you success with the selection process.

Best regards,
[Name]
[Title]

## Template 2: Strategic Fit Decline

**Subject:** RE: [Client Name] RFP Response

Dear [Contact Name],

Thank you for the opportunity to review the RFP for [project description]. We were impressed by the thoroughness of the brief and the ambition of the project.

After evaluating the requirements against our core capabilities, we believe other agencies may be better positioned to serve your specific needs, particularly in [specific area where we're not strong fit]. We want to ensure you work with a partner who can fully deliver on your vision.

If your needs evolve to include [our strength areas], we'd be honored to continue the conversation. In the meantime, we'd be happy to suggest agencies that might be excellent fits for this particular project if that would be helpful.

Thank you again for considering us.

Best regards,

## Template 3: Maintaining Warm Relationship

**Subject:** [Client Name] Opportunity — Our Decision

Dear [Contact Name],

I wanted to personally reach out regarding the [project name] RFP. First, thank you — it's clear significant thought went into this brief, and we're grateful to be considered.

We've given this careful consideration. While we're genuinely excited about [brand/company/challenge], we've decided to step back from this particular process. [Choose one: The timing doesn't work with our current commitments / The scope isn't quite aligned with where we're focused / We don't think we'd be the best fit for this specific challenge].

I don't want this to be the end of our conversation. [Company name] is doing interesting work, and I'd love to stay connected. Perhaps we could grab coffee in [month] to discuss what you're seeing in the market?

Best of luck with the pitch process — and please don't hesitate to reach out for future opportunities.

Warm regards,
[Name]

## Template 4: Budget Misalignment (Diplomatic)

**Subject:** RE: [RFP Name] — [Agency Name] Response

Dear [Contact Name],

Thank you for sharing the [project name] RFP with us. We appreciate the detail provided and the clear articulation of your goals.

After reviewing the scope and requirements, we've determined that we wouldn't be able to deliver the quality of work this project deserves within the budget parameters. We believe strongly in setting partnerships up for success from the start, which means being honest when we don't see alignment.

Should the scope or budget evolve, or if you have future projects that might be a better fit, we'd welcome the conversation. We're also happy to discuss a phased approach if that would be helpful.

Thank you again for considering [Agency Name].

Regards,
[Name]
[Title]

Best,
[Name]

## Phone/Video Call Talking Points

When declining requires a conversation (strong relationship, significant opportunity):

**Opening:**
"Thank you for including us in this process. I wanted to call directly because I respect our relationship and wanted to explain our decision."

**The Decline:**
"After careful review, we've decided not to submit a response for this particular opportunity."

**The Reason (choose appropriate):**
- "Our capacity right now wouldn't allow us to give this the attention it deserves."
- "When we mapped our capabilities against the requirements, we found gaps that wouldn't serve you well."
- "The timeline and our current commitments don't align in a way that would let us do our best work."
- "To be candid, we're not sure we're the right fit for [specific aspect], and we'd rather be honest than waste your time."

**Preserving Relationship:**
"This isn't a reflection of how we feel about [company]. I'd love to stay in touch and be considered when a project more aligned with our strengths comes up."

**Closing:**
"I genuinely wish you the best with this process. Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything else we can help with."

## What NOT to Say in Declines

Avoid these common mistakes:

❌ **Don't be vague to the point of confusing:**
"Due to various factors, we've decided..."

❌ **Don't criticize the RFP or client:**
"The budget is unrealistic for this scope..."

❌ **Don't reveal competitive intelligence:**
"We understand [competitor] is the likely winner..."

❌ **Don't burn bridges:**
"This RFP process seems disorganized..."

❌ **Don't over-explain:**
Long justifications sound defensive. Keep it professional and brief.

❌ **Don't leave the door completely closed:**
Always suggest future engagement possibility unless client is blacklisted.

## Tracking Declines

Log every no-bid decision:

```
CLIENT: 
DATE RECEIVED:
DATE DECLINED:
PRIMARY REASON: [Capacity / Fit / Budget / Timeline / Strategic / Red Flags]
SECONDARY FACTORS:
RELATIONSHIP VALUE: [High / Medium / Low]
FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULED: [Date if relationship worth maintaining]
NOTES:
```

Review decline patterns quarterly to identify:
- Are we declining strategically or reactively?
- What would have made these opportunities GOes?
- Are there capability gaps we should address?
- Are certain RFP sources consistently poor fit?
