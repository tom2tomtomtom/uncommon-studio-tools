## Differentiation Questions

### Why should they choose us specifically?

**Unique Value:**
- What can we do that competitors genuinely cannot?
- What do we know that competitors don't?
- What perspective do we bring that's distinctive?
- If we weren't in this pitch, would anyone notice?

**Proof Points:**
- Can we prove our differentiation, or is it just assertion?
- What's our most relevant case study, and why?
- What would a skeptic say about our credentials?
- What evidence would be most compelling to this specific client?

**Relevance:**
- Does our differentiation matter to this client?
- Are we emphasizing what we're proud of or what they need?
- Have we earned the right to claim what we're claiming?
- Would the client agree our differentiation is valuable?

## Response Quality Questions

### Are we competing on the right dimension?

**Execution vs. Counsel:**
- Does our response read like a capability catalogue or a strategic proposal?
- Have we demonstrated we can think, or just that we can do?
- Would this response win on execution or on insight?
- Are we positioning as partner or vendor?

**Safe vs. Memorable:**
- Is there anything in this response that would make us memorable?
- Have we said anything the client doesn't want to hear?
- Have we taken any risks, or played it completely safe?
- After reading 5 similar responses, would ours stand out?

**Brief Compliance vs. Brief Challenge:**
- Have we accepted the brief entirely at face value?
- Have we added value beyond what was asked?
- Have we reframed anything, or just answered the question?
- Does our response make the client think differently about their problem?

## Uncomfortable Truth Questions

### What does this client need to hear?

**The Diagnosis:**
- What's the uncomfortable truth about this client's situation?
- What are they avoiding or not seeing?
- What do their current advisors probably not tell them?
- What would a truly honest assessment include?

**The Delivery:**
- Can we say this in a way that's constructive, not critical?
- Is there a way to demonstrate this rather than just state it?
- What's the risk if we say it?
- What's the risk if we don't?

**The Value:**
- Would surfacing this truth differentiate us?
- Would it establish us as strategic counsel rather than executor?
- Is this client ready to hear it?
- Is the pitch meeting the right moment?

## The Meta-Questions

Before finalizing strategic assessment, ask:

1. **Have we told ourselves any comfortable lies about this opportunity?**

2. **Are we pursuing this because it's strategically right or because it's available?**

3. **Is our response designed to win the pitch or to establish the right relationship?**

4. **What would we advise a competitor to do with this opportunity?**

5. **If we could only pursue three RFPs this quarter, would this be one of them?**
