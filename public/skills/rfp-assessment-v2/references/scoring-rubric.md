## Part 2: Strategic Assessment Scoring

These additional dimensions evaluate response quality and positioning beyond qualification.

### F. BRIEF VALIDITY (Strategic Dimension)

**Purpose:** Assess whether the client is asking for the right thing.

#### Fully Valid Brief
- Client has correctly diagnosed their problem
- Objectives, if achieved, would solve the business need
- Metrics requested are meaningful, not vanity
- Strategic context is accurate and complete
- **Response approach:** Deliver what's asked, demonstrate excellence

#### Partially Valid Brief
- Core diagnosis is correct, but missing elements
- Some objectives are meaningful, others are symptoms
- Mix of useful and vanity metrics
- Strategic context has gaps
- **Response approach:** Deliver what's asked PLUS fill the gaps

#### Brief Needs Reframing
- Client is treating symptoms rather than causes
- Objectives won't actually solve the business problem
- Vanity metrics dominate
- Strategic context may be outdated or incomplete
- **Response approach:** Demonstrate you can deliver what's asked, but challenge the framing

#### Strategic Intervention Needed
- Client is solving the wrong problem entirely
- Achieving stated objectives may make things worse
- Metrics requested would mislead
- Fundamental strategic confusion
- **Response approach:** Lead with reframing, use pitch to educate

### G. RESPONSE QUALITY: TECHNICAL (Strategic Dimension)

Score 1-10 on execution quality:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Exceptional. Every requirement addressed with relevant proof. Compelling case studies, clear methodology, professional presentation. Would win on execution alone. |
| 7-8 | Strong. All requirements addressed, good evidence, clear approach. Minor gaps or areas that could be stronger. Competitive response. |
| 5-6 | Adequate. Most requirements addressed, some evidence provided. Gaps in methodology or proof points. Average competitive position. |
| 3-4 | Weak. Significant gaps in requirements coverage. Limited evidence. Unclear methodology. Below competitive threshold. |
| 1-2 | Poor. Major requirements missing. Little relevant evidence. Unclear or generic approach. Unlikely to advance. |

---

### H. RESPONSE QUALITY: STRATEGIC (Strategic Dimension)

Score 1-10 on strategic value:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Strategic partner positioning. Challenges brief assumptions constructively. Demonstrates insight client hasn't seen. Makes uncomfortable recommendations. Would be memorable after reviewing 10 similar responses. |
| 7-8 | Strong counsel signals. Some strategic challenge or reframing. Good insight beyond stated brief. Clear differentiation on approach, not just capability. |
| 5-6 | Competent but safe. Validates brief without challenging. Insight level matches what client already knows. Differentiates on capability, not thinking. |
| 3-4 | Order-taker positioning. Accepts brief entirely at face value. No insight beyond RFP content. Competes on price or credentials only. |
| 1-2 | Vendor positioning. Generic response that could apply to any client. No strategic value demonstrated. Unlikely to be considered for strategic work. |

**Key diagnostic:** If your response could have been written by any agency following standard frameworks, it's below 7.

---

### I. COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION (Strategic Dimension)

Assess distinctiveness of win themes:

#### Strong Differentiation
- Primary win theme is unique to this agency
- Competitors cannot credibly claim same positioning
- Theme is provable with specific evidence
- Theme directly addresses client's actual problem
- Would be remembered after the pitch

#### Moderate Differentiation  
- Win theme is strong but not unique
- Competitors might claim similar, but we can prove it better
- Good evidence, perhaps not definitive
- Theme addresses stated problem (may not address underlying dynamic)
- Reasonably memorable

#### Weak Differentiation
- Win theme is generic (innovation, results, partnership)
- Multiple competitors will claim similar
- Evidence is standard case studies
- Theme matches brief but doesn't exceed it
- Forgettable after the meeting

#### No Differentiation
- No clear win theme articulated
- Competing on capability and price only
- Generic credentials and claims
- Response doesn't answer "why us specifically"
- Interchangeable with other agencies

## Part 3: Combined Assessment Guide

### Interpretation Matrix

| Qualification Score | Strategic Quality | Interpretation |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Strong GO (4.0+) | High (7+) | Excellent position. Pursue aggressively with strategic pitch approach. |
| Strong GO (4.0+) | Medium (5-6) | Good opportunity, weak positioning. Strengthen response before pitch. |
| Strong GO (4.0+) | Low (<5) | Pursuing good opportunity badly. Significant response rework needed. |
| Conditional (3.0-3.9) | High (7+) | Strategic value may compensate for qualification gaps. Pursue with conditions. |
| Conditional (3.0-3.9) | Low (<5) | Mediocre opportunity with weak positioning. Reconsider pursuit. |
| NO-GO (<3.0) | Any | Don't pursue regardless of response quality. |

### The Strategic Premium

Responses with high strategic quality (8+) can compensate for:
- Moderate win probability (adds ~10% to win rate)
- Lower capability match (if positioning as strategic partner vs. executor)
- Higher competitive pressure (memorable differentiation cuts through)

Responses with low strategic quality (<5) suffer from:
- Competing on execution in crowded field
- Price pressure (commodity positioning invites negotiation)
- Vulnerability to strategic competitors
- Lower expansion potential post-win

## Weighting Adjustments

Default weights reflect typical priorities. Adjust for specific situations:

**For agencies prioritizing growth:**
- Increase Strategic Value to 30%
- Reduce Commercial to 10%

**For agencies with capacity constraints:**
- Increase Capability to 35%
- Reduce Strategic Value to 15%

**For agencies building category expertise:**
- Score same-category RFPs +1 on Strategic Value
- Apply stricter Commercial threshold

**For established agencies:**
- Increase Win Probability to 35%
- Reduce Capability to 20%

**For agencies seeking strategic positioning:**
- Weight strategic response quality heavily in pitch approach
- Consider declining execution-only opportunities even if qualified
