# RFP Strategic Assessment Framework

## Purpose

This framework serves two distinct but complementary functions:

1. **Opportunity Qualification** — Should we pursue this? (Systematic scoring)
2. **Strategic Assessment** — Are we pursuing it correctly? (Strategic judgment)

Most RFP frameworks only do the first. This one does both. Because winning the wrong way is often worse than not winning at all.

---

## The Two Questions

Every RFP assessment must answer:

**Question 1: Is this a good opportunity to pursue?**
- Capability match, win probability, commercial terms, client quality
- Answered through systematic scoring (Phases 1-5)
- Produces a GO/NO-GO recommendation

**Question 2: Is our response positioning us to win on the right terms?**
- Brief validity, strategic differentiation, response quality, pitch approach
- Answered through strategic analysis (Phase 6)
- Produces strategic recommendations for how to win

A "Strong GO" on Question 1 with weak positioning on Question 2 means you're pursuing a good opportunity badly.

---

## Phase 1: Rapid Triage (5-minute scan)

Before deep analysis, conduct instant qualification:

```
INSTANT DISQUALIFIERS (any = automatic NO-GO):
□ Deadline <2 weeks for substantial response
□ Open/public RFP with unknown respondent count  
□ Requires unpaid spec creative work
□ Budget clearly misaligned with scope (>50% gap)
□ Services requested outside core capabilities
□ Client in ethically problematic category
```

If no instant disqualifiers, proceed to full assessment.

---

## Phase 2: Strategic Fit Assessment

Score each dimension 1-5. See `references/scoring-rubric.md` for detailed criteria.

### A. CAPABILITY ALIGNMENT (Weight: 25%)

```
Questions to answer:
- Do we offer the core services requested?
- Do we have relevant category/sector experience?
- Can we meet technical/platform requirements?
- Do we have capacity within the timeline?

Score: ___/5
Reasoning: [Document specific capability matches/gaps]
```

### B. WIN PROBABILITY (Weight: 30%)

```
Questions to answer:
- Do we have an existing relationship with decision-maker?
- Were we invited or did we find this RFP?
- How many agencies are being considered?
- Is there an incumbent? What's their status?
- Does RFP language favor a competitor's approach?
- Did we shape the brief or learn about it early?

Score: ___/5
Reasoning: [Document relationship strength, competitive position]
```

### C. STRATEGIC VALUE (Weight: 20%)

```
Questions to answer:
- Does this align with our growth strategy/positioning?
- Would winning build expertise in a target category?
- Is this a referenceable lighthouse client?
- Does the scope allow for showcase-worthy work?
- Could this lead to larger engagement or AOR status?

Score: ___/5
Reasoning: [Document strategic benefits beyond revenue]
```

### D. COMMERCIAL VIABILITY (Weight: 15%)

```
Questions to answer:
- Is budget disclosed? Is it realistic for scope?
- Are payment terms acceptable (<60 days)?
- Is pricing structure compatible?
- What's the true profit potential after pitch costs?
- Are there concerning contract terms?

Score: ___/5
Reasoning: [Document financial analysis]
```

### E. CLIENT QUALITY SIGNALS (Weight: 10%)

```
Questions to answer:
- Is the RFP well-written and thorough?
- Are goals/KPIs clearly articulated?
- Is there a single decision-maker identified?
- Did they allow Q&A or chemistry meeting?
- What's their reputation for agency relationships?

Score: ___/5
Reasoning: [Document client sophistication indicators]
```

---

## Phase 3: Red Flag Analysis

See `references/red-flags.md` for comprehensive checklist.

Document each flag identified:

```
FLAG: [Description]
SEVERITY: [Minor / Moderate / Serious / Critical]
SOURCE: [RFP doc, research, network intel]
MITIGATION: [Can this be addressed? How?]
IMPACT: [Effect on recommendation if unresolved]
```

**Key distinction:** A sophisticated client who's misdiagnosed their own problem is a different kind of risk than an unsophisticated client who doesn't know what they want. Both are flags, but they require different responses.

---

## Phase 4: Resource & Cost Analysis

```
PURSUIT COSTS ESTIMATE:
- Hours for written response: ___
- Hours for pitch presentation: ___
- Team members involved: ___
- Out-of-pocket costs: $___
- Opportunity cost (work deferred): $___

TOTAL PURSUIT INVESTMENT: $___

WIN VALUE:
- Estimated annual revenue: $___
- Pursuit cost as % of Y1 revenue: ___%
- Expected value (revenue × win probability): $___
- 3-year LTV potential: $___
```

**Benchmark:** Pursuit costs of 8-15% of first-year revenue are typical for competitive pitches. Below 8% suggests incumbent advantage or limited competition. Above 15% requires exceptional strategic value to justify.

---

## Phase 5: Qualification Decision

Calculate weighted score:

```
Dimension          Score (1-5)    Weight    Weighted
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Capability           ___          0.25      ___
Win Probability      ___          0.30      ___
Strategic Value      ___          0.20      ___
Commercial           ___          0.15      ___
Client Quality       ___          0.10      ___
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL WEIGHTED SCORE:              ___/5.00
```

**Decision Thresholds:**
- **4.0-5.0**: Strong GO — Full pursuit recommended
- **3.0-3.9**: Conditional GO — Pursue with modifications
- **2.0-2.9**: Lean NO-GO — Pursue only if strategic exception
- **Below 2.0**: Definite NO-GO — Decline professionally

**STOP HERE if NO-GO.** Use `references/decline-templates.md` for professional response.

**If GO, proceed to Phase 6** — this is where most frameworks end, but it's where strategic value begins.

---

## Phase 6: Strategic Assessment

This phase moves beyond "should we pursue?" to "how should we win?"

### 6A. BRIEF VALIDITY ANALYSIS

**The critical question most agencies skip:** Is the client asking for the right thing?

```
BRIEF DIAGNOSIS:

Surface Problem (what client says they need):
_________________________________________________

Underlying Dynamic (what's actually happening):
_________________________________________________

Brief Validity Assessment:
□ Client has correctly diagnosed their problem
□ Client has partially diagnosed — missing key elements
□ Client is solving wrong problem — brief needs reframing
□ Client is optimizing for wrong outcome — strategic intervention needed

Evidence for assessment:
_________________________________________________
```

**Warning signs the brief may be wrong:**
- Vanity metrics as primary objectives (SOV, impressions, reach)
- Tactics requested without strategic context
- Incumbent identity crisis (market leader acting like challenger, or vice versa)
- Symptoms being treated rather than causes
- Objectives that, if achieved, wouldn't actually solve the business problem

**If brief validity is questionable:** Your response should demonstrate you can deliver what was asked AND challenge the assumptions. This is the difference between account management and strategic counsel.

### 6B. COMPETITIVE TRUTH

```
What is the real competitive battle here?

The stated competition (who client named):
_________________________________________________

The actual competition (what we observe):
_________________________________________________

The competitive dynamic client may not see:
_________________________________________________
```

**Look for:**
- Category incumbents pretending to be challengers
- Challengers who've become incumbents without realizing it
- Competition from adjacent categories or new entrants
- Internal competition (status quo, do-nothing option)
- Perception gaps between market position and communications

### 6C. RESPONSE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Evaluate the agency's response against two criteria:

**As a Pitch Document (Technical Quality):**
```
Score: ___/10

□ Addresses all RFP requirements
□ Demonstrates relevant experience with proof points
□ Team structure appropriate for scope
□ Clear methodology and approach
□ Compelling case studies
□ Professional presentation quality
□ Appropriate length (comprehensive but not overwhelming)
□ Measurement framework included
□ Ways of working clearly articulated
□ Commercial terms addressed
```

**As Strategic Counsel (Strategic Quality):**
```
Score: ___/10

□ Challenges or validates brief assumptions (doesn't just accept)
□ Demonstrates insight client hasn't seen before
□ Positions agency as strategic partner, not vendor
□ Includes at least one uncomfortable recommendation
□ Shows understanding of competitive dynamics beyond stated brief
□ Proposes what success actually looks like (not just what was asked)
□ Differentiates on strategic approach, not just capability
□ Makes a strategic bet about what matters most
□ Demonstrates conviction, not just competence
□ Would be memorable after reviewing 5 similar responses
```

**Interpretation:**
- High technical + high strategic = Strong position
- High technical + low strategic = Competing on execution (vulnerable)
- Low technical + high strategic = Good thinking, poor packaging
- Low technical + low strategic = Unlikely to win

### 6D. WIN THEME ANALYSIS

```
PRIMARY WIN THEME:
What is the single most compelling reason to choose us?
_________________________________________________

Is this theme:
□ Distinctive (competitors can't credibly claim it)
□ Provable (we have evidence, not just assertion)
□ Relevant (client actually cares about this)
□ Memorable (will stick after the meeting)

SUPPORTING THEMES:
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES:
What will competitors say about us?
_________________________________________________

How do we preempt or address this?
_________________________________________________
```

### 6E. THE STRATEGIC PROVOCATION TEST

Ask: **What uncomfortable truth should we tell this client?**

Every client has something they need to hear but aren't hearing from their current advisors. Identifying and articulating this is what separates strategic partners from vendors.

```
THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH:
_________________________________________________

WHY IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE:
_________________________________________________

WHY IT'S TRUE:
_________________________________________________

HOW TO DELIVER IT CONSTRUCTIVELY:
_________________________________________________

RISK IF WE SAY IT:
_________________________________________________

RISK IF WE DON'T:
_________________________________________________
```

**If you can't identify an uncomfortable truth:** Either the client's brief is perfect (rare) or you haven't thought hard enough about their business.

**If you identify it but don't include it in the response:** You're competing on execution, not counsel.

### 6F. PITCH MEETING STRATEGY

The written response is a qualifying round. The real decision happens in the room.

```
OPENING STRATEGY:
How will we use the first 3 minutes to differentiate?

□ Lead with credentials (safe, conventional)
□ Lead with insight about their business (moderate risk, memorable)
□ Lead with strategic provocation (higher risk, highest differentiation)

Recommended opening:
_________________________________________________

DEMONSTRATION MOMENTS:
What can we show, not just tell?
_________________________________________________

QUESTIONS THEY'LL ASK:
Anticipate and prepare for:
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

THE ASK:
What do we want them to do/feel/believe after the meeting?
_________________________________________________
```

## Quick Reference: The Two Assessments

```
QUALIFICATION (Phases 1-5)          STRATEGIC (Phase 6)
────────────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────────
Should we pursue?                   Are we pursuing correctly?
Systematic scoring                  Strategic judgment
Capability, probability, value      Brief validity, positioning
GO/NO-GO decision                   How to win recommendation
Every agency does this              Few agencies do this
Table stakes                        Differentiation
```

**The goal:** Not just to win, but to win on terms that create sustainable value for both agency and client.
