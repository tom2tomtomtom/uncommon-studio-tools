# Brand Audit

A structured framework for conducting comprehensive brand health assessments. This skill guides you through evaluating visual identity, messaging consistency, competitive positioning, stakeholder perception, and digital presence to produce actionable brand intelligence.

## When to Use

- A client requests a brand health check before a rebrand or refresh
- Onboarding a new client and need to benchmark their current brand state
- Annual or quarterly brand performance reviews
- Post-merger or acquisition brand integration planning
- Before launching a new product line or entering a new market
- When brand metrics (awareness, sentiment, loyalty) are declining
- Internal alignment concerns -- teams interpreting the brand differently

## Audit Framework

### 1. Brand Identity Review

Evaluate the foundational brand elements for clarity, differentiation, and relevance.

**Core elements to assess:**
- Mission, vision, and values -- are they documented, current, and actionable?
- Brand purpose -- does it connect to a genuine customer or societal need?
- Brand promise -- is it clear, credible, and consistently delivered?
- Brand personality and archetype -- is it defined and reflected in communications?
- Brand story and origin narrative -- is it compelling and authentic?
- Value proposition -- does it articulate unique benefit vs. alternatives?

**Scoring criteria:**
- Documented (yes/no)
- Current -- updated within last 2 years (yes/no)
- Differentiated -- meaningfully distinct from top 3 competitors (1-5 scale)
- Internally known -- staff can articulate without prompting (1-5 scale)

### 2. Visual Consistency Audit

Review all brand touchpoints for visual coherence and guideline adherence.

**Touchpoints to review:**
- Logo usage (primary, secondary, icon variations)
- Color palette adherence (primary, secondary, accent)
- Typography consistency (headings, body, UI)
- Photography and illustration style
- Iconography and graphic elements
- Layout and grid systems
- Motion and animation style (if applicable)

**Channels to audit:**
- Website and web applications
- Social media profiles and content
- Email templates and campaigns
- Print materials (business cards, brochures, signage)
- Presentations and pitch decks
- Packaging and physical products
- Advertising (digital and traditional)
- Internal documents and templates

**Rating scale:**
- 5 -- Fully consistent, follows guidelines precisely
- 4 -- Mostly consistent, minor deviations
- 3 -- Inconsistent, noticeable deviations across channels
- 2 -- Significantly inconsistent, guidelines loosely followed
- 1 -- No consistency, no evidence of guidelines in use

### 3. Messaging Alignment Check

Assess whether verbal identity is consistent and effective across all communications.

**Elements to evaluate:**
- Tagline and strapline usage
- Tone of voice consistency (formal/casual, technical/accessible, serious/playful)
- Key message pillars -- are they defined and used?
- Elevator pitch consistency across teams
- Product and service naming conventions
- CTAs and recurring language patterns
- Boilerplate and "about" copy across channels

**Alignment matrix:**
Map each channel against each message pillar. Score 1-5 on how well the channel delivers that pillar. Identify gaps where key messages are absent.

### 4. Competitive Positioning Analysis

Evaluate the brand's position relative to its competitive set.

**Steps:**
1. Identify competitive set (direct competitors, indirect competitors, aspirational peers)
2. Map positioning dimensions relevant to the category (e.g., price vs. quality, innovative vs. traditional, premium vs. accessible)
3. Assess share of voice across key channels
4. Compare visual identity distinctiveness -- would audiences confuse the brands?
5. Evaluate messaging differentiation -- are claims unique or category-generic?
6. Review customer switching triggers and loyalty drivers

**Positioning scorecard:**
- Distinctiveness (1-5) -- how visually and verbally unique
- Relevance (1-5) -- how well positioned for target audience needs
- Credibility (1-5) -- does the brand deliver on its positioning claims
- Consistency (1-5) -- is positioning maintained across all touchpoints
- Stretch potential (1-5) -- can the positioning support future growth

### 5. Customer and Stakeholder Perception

Gather external perspectives on how the brand is actually experienced.

**Research methods:**
- Customer surveys (brand awareness, associations, NPS, satisfaction)
- Social listening and sentiment analysis
- Online review mining (Google, G2, Trustpilot, Glassdoor)
- Stakeholder interviews (customers, partners, investors, media)
- Search behavior analysis (what terms lead people to the brand)
- Support ticket and feedback analysis for recurring brand-related themes

**Key perception metrics:**
- Unaided brand awareness -- can target audience name the brand unprompted?
- Aided brand awareness -- do they recognize it when shown?
- Brand associations -- top 3-5 words or concepts linked to the brand
- Net Promoter Score or equivalent loyalty metric
- Perceived quality vs. actual quality
- Emotional connection score

### 6. Digital Presence Audit

Evaluate the brand's digital ecosystem for strength, consistency, and performance.

**Areas to assess:**
- Website (UX, content quality, SEO, load performance, accessibility)
- Social media (platform presence, follower quality, engagement rates, content mix)
- Search presence (branded search volume, SERP ownership, featured snippets)
- Paid media (ad quality, landing page consistency, retargeting)
- Email marketing (template quality, deliverability, engagement)
- Directory and listing accuracy (Google Business, industry directories)
- App presence (if applicable -- store listing, ratings, reviews)

### 7. Internal Brand Alignment

Assess how well the organization understands and lives the brand.

**Evaluation methods:**
- Employee survey on brand values, mission, and voice
- Review of internal communications for brand consistency
- Hiring and onboarding materials -- do they reflect the brand?
- Sales enablement materials -- are they on-brand?
- Customer service scripts and responses -- do they reflect brand voice?
- Physical workspace -- does the environment embody the brand?

**Alignment indicators:**
- Can employees articulate the brand promise in their own words?
- Do different departments describe the brand consistently?
- Is there a gap between leadership's brand vision and frontline experience?
- Are brand guidelines accessible and used by all teams?

## Audit Methodology

### Phase 1: Desk Research (Week 1)

### Phase 2: Stakeholder Input (Week 2)
- Conduct internal interviews (leadership, marketing, sales, support)
- Deploy customer survey if budget allows
- Run social listening analysis
- Gather partner and vendor perspectives

### Phase 3: Analysis and Scoring (Week 3)
- Score each audit dimension using the frameworks above
- Identify patterns, gaps, and contradictions
- Build the competitive positioning map
- Synthesize perception data with internal assessments

### Phase 4: Recommendations (Week 4)
- Prioritize findings by impact and effort
- Develop short-term fixes (quick wins) and long-term strategic recommendations
- Create the deliverable package

## Brand SWOT Framework

Apply SWOT specifically through a brand lens:

- **Strengths**: What brand assets are most valuable? Where is consistency strongest? What do customers love most?
- **Weaknesses**: Where does the brand break down? What channels are neglected? Where is internal alignment weakest?
- **Opportunities**: What audience segments are underserved? What channels are untapped? What brand stories are untold?
- **Threats**: What competitor moves endanger positioning? What market shifts could make the brand irrelevant? What internal risks exist (leadership change, culture shift)?
