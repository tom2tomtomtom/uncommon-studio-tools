# Project Kickoff Builder

This skill generates comprehensive project kickoff documents for Uncommon Studio engagements. A strong kickoff sets the tone for the entire project -- it aligns expectations, establishes communication norms, identifies risks early, and gives every stakeholder a clear picture of what happens next. This skill produces both the kickoff document and a meeting agenda for the kickoff session.

## When to Use

- A new project has been signed and work is about to begin
- A major new phase of an existing engagement is launching
- A retainer relationship is being formalized and needs a working framework
- A project has stalled and needs to be re-kicked with updated parameters
- An internal project needs structure and accountability

## Kickoff Document Structure

### 1. Project Overview

Provide a concise summary of the project:

- **Project name**: Official name used across all communications
- **Client**: Company name and primary brand or division
- **Project type**: Brand identity, campaign, website, content program, etc.
- **SOW reference**: SOW number and execution date
- **Project duration**: Start and end dates
- **Budget**: Total project investment (include if appropriate for audience)

Write a 3-5 sentence narrative overview that explains what we are building, why it matters, and what success looks like. This paragraph should be understandable to anyone joining the project mid-stream.

### 2. Objectives

List 3-5 clear, measurable objectives for the project. Each objective should follow the format:

"**[Verb] [what]** -- [how we will measure it]"

Examples:
- "**Launch redesigned e-commerce site** -- live and transactional by June 15"
- "**Increase organic social engagement** -- achieve 25% lift in average engagement rate within 90 days"
- "**Deliver brand identity system** -- approved brand guidelines document with all assets by Q2 end"

### 3. Team and Roles

#### Uncommon Studio Team

| Role | Name | Responsibility | Email |
|------|------|---------------|-------|
| Account Lead | [Name] | Primary client contact, project oversight | |
| Project Manager | [Name] | Timeline, budget, resource management | |
| Creative Director | [Name] | Creative vision, quality standards | |
| Designer | [Name] | Design execution, asset production | |
| Strategist | [Name] | Research, strategy, messaging | |
| Developer | [Name] | Technical implementation | |

#### Client Team

| Role | Name | Responsibility | Email |
|------|------|---------------|-------|
| Project Sponsor | [Name] | Final decision maker, budget authority | |
| Day-to-Day Contact | [Name] | Primary point of contact for the studio | |
| Subject Matter Expert | [Name] | Content, product, or technical input | |
| Legal/Compliance | [Name] | Review and approval for regulated content | |

Clearly identify the single decision maker on each side. Projects with unclear decision-making authority are the leading cause of timeline delays.

### 4. Communication Plan

Define how the teams will communicate:

**Regular Meetings**
- **Status meeting**: [Frequency -- weekly/biweekly], [Day and time], [Duration], [Platform -- Zoom/Teams/In-person]
- **Creative reviews**: [Frequency], [Format -- live presentation/async review]
- **Executive check-in**: [Frequency -- monthly/quarterly], [Attendees]

**Communication Channels**
- **Day-to-day communication**: [Email / Slack / Teams channel]
- **File sharing**: [Google Drive / Dropbox / SharePoint link]
- **Project management**: [Asana / Monday / Basecamp link]
- **Design review**: [Figma / InVision link]

**Response Time Expectations**
- Routine questions: 1 business day
- Feedback on deliverables: [X] business days (as defined in SOW)
- Urgent issues: Same business day
- After-hours: Emergency contact only -- [name and phone]

### 5. Ways of Working

Document the norms that keep the project running smoothly:

**Feedback Guidelines**
- All feedback should be consolidated into a single document or comment thread per review round
- Feedback should be specific and actionable (not "make it pop" -- instead "increase contrast between headline and background")
- Conflicting feedback from multiple stakeholders should be resolved on the client side before returning to the studio
- Each review round has [X] business days for feedback (per SOW)

**File and Asset Management**
- Naming convention: [ProjectCode]_[Deliverable]_[Version]_[Date] (e.g., UNC_Homepage_v2_20260216)
- Version control: All files shared via [platform], latest version always in [specific folder]
- Final assets delivered via [method]

**Meeting Norms**
- Agendas sent 24 hours before meetings
- Notes and action items distributed within 1 business day after meetings
- Decisions made in meetings are documented in writing

### 6. Key Dates and Milestones

| Milestone | Date | Owner | Dependencies |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Project kickoff | [Date] | Studio + Client | SOW execution |
| Discovery/research complete | [Date] | Studio | Client interviews |
| Strategy presentation | [Date] | Studio | Discovery complete |
| Creative concepts (Round 1) | [Date] | Studio | Strategy approval |
| Client feedback on Round 1 | [Date] | Client | -- |
| Revised concepts (Round 2) | [Date] | Studio | Client feedback |
| Final approval | [Date] | Client | -- |
| Production/build | [Date] | Studio | Final approval |
| QA and testing | [Date] | Studio + Client | Build complete |
| Launch/delivery | [Date] | Studio | QA approval |
| Post-launch review | [Date] | Studio + Client | Launch |

Flag any dates that are hard deadlines (events, seasonal windows, board meetings) vs. target dates that have flexibility.

### 7. Approval and Review Process

Define the approval workflow clearly:

**Review Rounds**
- This project includes [X] rounds of revision per deliverable (per SOW)
- Additional rounds beyond the included amount will be handled via change order
- Each round assumes consolidated feedback from a single client point of contact

**Approval Levels**
1. **Working review**: Day-to-day contact reviews for accuracy and direction
2. **Stakeholder review**: Key stakeholders review for strategic alignment
3. **Final approval**: Decision maker provides written sign-off

**Approval Method**
- Written approval via email is required to proceed past each milestone
- Verbal approvals will be followed up with a written confirmation email
- Silence beyond the feedback window will be escalated per the communication plan

### 8. Risk Register

Identify known risks at the start of the project:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Client feedback delays | Medium | High -- shifts all downstream dates | Built-in buffer of [X] days; escalation protocol | PM |
| Stakeholder changes | Low | High -- potential rework | Document all approvals in writing | Account Lead |
| Technical complexity | Medium | Medium -- may require additional dev time | Technical discovery sprint in Week 1 | Developer |
| Content delays | High | High -- blocks design work | Content deadlines set 2 weeks before design needs | PM |
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium -- budget and timeline pressure | Change order process defined and agreed | Account Lead |
| Brand guideline gaps | Low | Low -- requires interpretation | Early alignment on brand standards | Creative Director |

Assign a risk owner for each item and define the trigger for escalation.

### 9. Budget Overview

If appropriate for the audience, include:

- **Total project investment**: $[amount]
- **Payment schedule**: [milestone-based / monthly / upon completion]
- **What is included**: Summarize deliverables at a high level
- **What is not included**: Explicitly note common assumptions (e.g., "Does not include media spend, stock photography licensing, or third-party hosting fees")
- **Change order process**: Reference the process for handling out-of-scope requests

### 10. Tools and Systems

List all platforms the team will use:

| Purpose | Tool | Access Required |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Project management | [Asana/Monday/Basecamp] | Client team invites sent |
| Design collaboration | [Figma/InVision] | Client review access |
| File storage | [Google Drive/Dropbox] | Shared folder created |
| Communication | [Slack/Teams] | Channel created |
| Video meetings | [Zoom/Teams] | Calendar invites sent |
| Development staging | [URL] | Password shared separately |
| Analytics | [GA4/platform] | Access requested |

Note any access that needs to be provisioned by the client and include it as an action item.

## Internal vs Client-Facing Kickoff

### Internal Kickoff Document
Include all sections above, plus:
- Detailed budget breakdown with margins and hours
- Team availability and capacity notes
- Internal risks (staffing, competing priorities)
- Lessons learned from similar past projects
- Profitability targets

### Client-Facing Kickoff Document
Include all sections above, but:
- Remove internal budget details and margins
- Remove team availability notes
- Frame risks as proactive planning, not concerns
- Omit internal lessons learned
- Focus on partnership and shared accountability language
