# Change Order Writer

This skill generates professional change orders and scope amendments for Uncommon Studio projects. Change orders formalize modifications to an active project -- whether the client requests additional work, the scope needs to be reduced, or timelines require adjustment. Every change order protects both the studio and the client by documenting what is changing, why, and what it costs.

## When to Use

- A client requests work that falls outside the original scope of work (SOW)
- The project timeline needs to shift due to client delays or new requirements
- Deliverables need to be added, removed, or modified
- Budget needs to increase or decrease based on scope changes
- Technical requirements or specifications change mid-project
- Stakeholder or approval process changes affect the workflow

## Change Order Structure

### 1. Change Order Header

Include these fields at the top of every change order:

- **Change Order Number**: CO-[ProjectCode]-[Sequential Number] (e.g., CO-UNC-2026-003)
- **Date Issued**: Date the change order is prepared
- **Project Name**: Full project name as it appears on the original SOW
- **Original SOW Reference**: SOW number and date
- **Client Name**: Legal entity name
- **Prepared By**: Account lead or project manager name
- **Requested By**: Name and role of person who initiated the change

### 2. Original Scope Summary

Briefly restate the relevant portion of the original scope that is being modified. Keep this to 2-4 sentences. Reference the specific section or deliverable number from the original SOW.

Template:
"Per the original SOW ([reference number], dated [date]), the project scope includes [brief description of relevant deliverables]. This change order modifies the scope as described below."

### 3. Requested Change Description

Clearly describe what is changing. Be specific and unambiguous:

- **What is being added, removed, or modified**
- **Why the change is being requested** -- client request, technical discovery, strategic pivot
- **How the change relates to the original scope** -- is it an extension, replacement, or new addition

Use plain language. Avoid subjective descriptions. A third party should be able to read this section and understand exactly what changed.

### 4. Impact Assessment

#### Timeline Impact

- **Original milestone/delivery date**: [date]
- **Revised milestone/delivery date**: [date]
- **Net change**: [+/- X business days/weeks]
- **Reason for timeline change**: Additional production time, new review cycles, vendor lead times, etc.

If no timeline impact, state: "This change does not affect the project timeline."

#### Budget Impact

- **Original project budget**: $[amount]
- **Change order amount**: +/- $[amount]
- **Revised total project budget**: $[amount]
- **Breakdown of additional costs**: Itemize by deliverable, labor category, or vendor cost

If no budget impact, state: "This change does not affect the project budget."

#### Resource Impact

- **Additional team members or hours required**
- **Vendor or contractor implications**
- **Impact on other active projects or workstreams**

### 5. Revised Deliverables

Provide an updated deliverables list showing what the project now includes. Mark changes clearly:

- [Original deliverable -- unchanged]
- [Original deliverable -- MODIFIED: description of change]
- [NEW: Added deliverable with description]
- [REMOVED: Deliverable no longer in scope]

### 6. Revised Timeline

If the timeline changes, provide an updated milestone schedule:

| Milestone | Original Date | Revised Date | Change |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Creative concepts | Mar 1 | Mar 1 | No change |
| Design revisions | Mar 15 | Mar 22 | +5 business days |
| Final delivery | Apr 1 | Apr 10 | +7 business days |

### 7. Revised Investment

Provide a clear financial summary:

| Line Item | Original | Change | Revised |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Creative development | $15,000 | +$5,000 | $20,000 |
| Production | $10,000 | -- | $10,000 |
| Media management | $8,000 | -- | $8,000 |
| **Total** | **$33,000** | **+$5,000** | **$38,000** |

Include payment terms for the additional amount: "Additional fees of $[amount] will be invoiced [upon approval / net 30 / per original payment schedule]."

### 8. Approval Signature Block

Template:

"By signing below, both parties agree to the changes described in this change order. This change order becomes part of the original agreement referenced above. All other terms and conditions of the original SOW remain in effect unless explicitly modified herein.

**Client Approval**
Name: ____________________
Title: ____________________
Signature: ____________________
Date: ____________________

**Uncommon Studio Approval**
Name: ____________________
Title: ____________________
Signature: ____________________
Date: ____________________"

## Change Types and Language

### Scope Addition

Use when the client requests new deliverables or additional work.

Opening language: "The client has requested the addition of [description] to the project scope. This work was not included in the original SOW and requires additional time and investment as outlined below."

### Scope Reduction

Use when deliverables are being removed or simplified.

Opening language: "By mutual agreement, [description] will be removed from the project scope. The revised scope and associated budget reduction are outlined below."

### Timeline Change

Use when dates shift but deliverables and budget remain the same.

Opening language: "Due to [reason -- client review delays, stakeholder availability, external dependencies], the project timeline requires adjustment. Deliverables and budget remain unchanged."

### Specification Change

Use when the nature of a deliverable changes but the count stays the same.

Opening language: "The specifications for [deliverable] have been revised from [original spec] to [new spec]. This modification impacts [timeline/budget/both] as outlined below."

## Escalation Language

For changes driven by client-side delays, use neutral but clear language:

- "Due to the extended review period beyond the [X business days] outlined in the original SOW..."
- "As a result of stakeholder changes on the client side, additional rounds of revision are required..."
- "The revised brand guidelines received on [date] require rework of previously approved deliverables..."

For changes driven by studio-side discoveries:

- "During the development phase, our team identified [technical requirement / complexity] that was not anticipated in the original scope..."
- "Based on performance data gathered during the initial phase, we recommend modifying the approach to..."

## Rush Fee Language

When a change requires expedited work:

"The requested timeline for this additional work is [X days/weeks] shorter than our standard production schedule. A rush fee of [percentage or flat amount] applies to expedited deliverables as outlined below."

## Terms and Conditions Notes

Include when relevant:

- "This change order must be approved before work begins. Any work performed prior to approval is at the client's verbal authorization and will be invoiced regardless of written approval status."
- "Approval of this change order constitutes authorization to invoice for the additional amount specified."
- "If this change order is not approved within [X] business days of issuance, the original timeline may require further adjustment."

## Output Template

When generating a change order, produce content in this order:

1. Change order header with reference numbers
2. Original scope summary (2-4 sentences)
3. Requested change description
4. Impact assessment (timeline, budget, resources)
5. Revised deliverables list
6. Revised timeline table (if applicable)
7. Revised investment table
8. Payment terms for additional amount
9. Terms and conditions notes (if applicable)
10. Approval signature block
