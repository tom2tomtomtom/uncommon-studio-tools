# Talking Points & Key Messages

Equip spokespeople to stay on message while sounding natural. The goal: confident delivery of key messages regardless of questions asked.

## Message Hierarchy

### Primary Message
The single most important takeaway. If the audience remembers one thing, this is it.

Format: [Subject] + [Action/Claim] + [Benefit/Impact]

Example: "Our new platform reduces checkout time by 40%, getting customers on their way faster."

### Supporting Messages (3-4 maximum)
Proof points that reinforce the primary message.

Each supporting message should:
- Provide evidence for the primary claim
- Stand alone as a coherent statement
- Be memorable and quotable

### Proof Points
Specific facts, data, or examples that validate each supporting message.

## Talking Points Structure

### Writing Rules

- Use conversational language — read aloud to test
- Keep each point under 20 words
- Lead with the most compelling element
- Use active voice
- Include specific numbers where possible
- Avoid jargon unless audience expects it

## Bridge Phrases

Bridges connect any question back to key messages without appearing evasive.

### Redirecting

- "That's an important point, and what's particularly relevant here is..."
- "What I can tell you is..."
- "The key issue is..."
- "What matters most to our customers is..."

### Acknowledging then Pivoting

- "That's one perspective. What we're focused on is..."
- "I understand the concern. What we're doing about it is..."
- "While I can't speak to that specifically, what I can say is..."

### Buying Time

- "Let me make sure I address that properly..."
- "That's a good question. The way I'd frame it is..."
- "There are a few aspects to that..."

## Deflection Guidance

### Questions to Redirect
- Speculation about competitors
- Unconfirmed information
- Topics outside spokesperson's expertise
- Commercially sensitive details

### How to Deflect Professionally

**"I don't know"**
→ "I don't have that information to hand, but I can follow up" / "That's outside my area, but I can connect you with someone who can help"

**Commercially sensitive**
→ "That's commercially sensitive, but what I can share is..."

**Speculation**
→ "I don't want to speculate. What I can tell you about our position is..."

**Hostile framing**
→ "I wouldn't characterise it that way. What I would say is..."

## Q&A Development

### Anticipate Questions By Category

**Clarifying**: Details about the announcement
**Challenging**: Potential criticisms or concerns
**Comparative**: How does this compare to competitors/alternatives
**Forward-looking**: Future plans and implications
**Personal**: Why does this matter to you/your organisation

### Q&A Format

```
Q: [Anticipated question]

Key points:
• [Main answer point]
• [Supporting detail]

Suggested response:
"[Natural language answer incorporating key points and bridge to primary message]"

Caution:
[What to avoid saying or committing to]
```

## Spokesperson Briefing Document

1. **Context** — Why this interview/opportunity
2. **Audience** — Who will see this, what do they care about
3. **Objectives** — What success looks like
4. **Key Messages** — Primary + supporting
