# Brand Voice Enforcer

Ensure every piece of copy sounds like it came from the same brand. Consistency builds trust; inconsistency erodes it.

## How This Works

This skill requires a client-specific brand voice guide to be effective. Without documented guidelines, apply general best practices and flag for client confirmation.

## Voice Review Process

### 1. Identify Applicable Guidelines

Before reviewing, confirm:
- Which client/brand is this for?
- Do we have documented voice guidelines?
- Are there specific rules for this content type?
- Any recent updates or exceptions?

If no guidelines exist, note this and recommend developing them.

### 2. Assess Core Voice Attributes

Rate the copy against brand voice dimensions:

**Tone spectrum** (where should this brand sit?):
- Formal ←→ Casual
- Serious ←→ Playful
- Corporate ←→ Human
- Expert ←→ Accessible
- Reserved ←→ Enthusiastic

**Voice consistency checklist**:
- [ ] Matches documented tone guidelines
- [ ] Consistent across all sections
- [ ] Appropriate for content type and channel
- [ ] Audience-appropriate

### 3. Terminology Check

**Brand-specific terms**:
- [ ] Product/service names spelled correctly
- [ ] Trademarked terms used properly
- [ ] Brand-specific terminology applied
- [ ] Competitor names handled per guidelines

**Prohibited terms**:
- [ ] No blacklisted words/phrases
- [ ] No competitor mentions (if prohibited)
- [ ] No unapproved claims

**Style preferences**:
- [ ] Numbers (spelled out vs. numerals)
- [ ] Dates (format)
- [ ] Capitalisation (title case, sentence case)
- [ ] Punctuation (Oxford comma, etc.)
- [ ] Contractions (allowed/prohibited)

### 4. Messaging Alignment

**Key messages**:
- [ ] Primary message present/implied
- [ ] Supporting messages consistent
- [ ] No conflicting claims
- [ ] Value proposition clear

**Claims and proof**:
- [ ] Claims approved for use
- [ ] Legal disclaimers included where required
- [ ] Statistics correctly cited
- [ ] Testimonials attributed properly

### 5. Channel Appropriateness

Content should flex while maintaining voice:

**Formal channels** (annual reports, investor comms):
- More structured
- Professional tone
- Complete sentences
- Minimal contractions

**Marketing channels** (campaigns, social):
- Can be more playful
- Shorter sentences
- More personality
- CTAs appropriate

**Customer service channels**:
- Warm and helpful
- Clear and direct
- Empathetic tone
- Action-oriented

## Voice Guide Template

|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Formality | [Position] | [Opposite] |
| Humour | [Position] | [Opposite] |
| Authority | [Position] | [Opposite] |
| Energy | [Position] | [Opposite] |

### Writing Style

- Contractions: [Yes/no/sparingly]

- Jargon: [Use freely/explain/avoid]

### Terminology Guide

| [Preferred term] | ✓ | [Alternatives to avoid] | [Context] |

### Example Phrases
**Instead of... → Say...**
- "[Generic phrase]" → "[On-brand alternative]"
- "[Off-tone phrase]" → "[On-brand alternative]"

### Content Examples

"[Example copy that nails the voice]"

## Common Voice Issues

**Inconsistent formality**: Mixing casual and corporate language
**Generic copy**: Could be any brand, no personality
**Jargon overload**: Inaccessible to audience
**Passive voice**: Weakens impact and clarity
**Feature-focus**: All about product, not benefit to reader
**Tone-deaf**: Wrong tone for context or channel
