# Internal Communications Writer

A framework for crafting effective employee communications across all formats and sensitivity levels. This skill covers tone, channel selection, message framing, cascade planning, and templates for every type of internal communication -- from celebratory announcements to difficult organizational changes.

## When to Use

- Writing all-hands or town hall presentations and talking points
- Drafting CEO or leadership updates (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Communicating policy changes, benefits updates, or process changes
- Announcing new hires, promotions, departures, or team restructuring
- Creating culture and values content for intranet or internal channels
- Managing change communication programs (reorgs, mergers, new tools)
- Developing crisis communication for internal audiences
- Writing onboarding content or employee handbook updates

## Communication Types and Frameworks

### 1. All-Hands and Town Hall Content

**Purpose:** Align the entire organization around strategy, progress, and priorities.

**Structure:**
1. **Opening -- Connection** (2-3 min): Acknowledge the team, reference recent wins or shared experiences
2. **Business update** (10-15 min): Key metrics, progress against goals, market context
3. **Strategic focus** (10-15 min): Deep dive on one priority area with clear "what this means for you"
4. **Team spotlights** (5-10 min): Celebrate specific contributions and cross-functional wins
5. **Looking ahead** (5 min): Upcoming milestones, what to expect, calls to action
6. **Q&A** (15-20 min): Open floor, pre-seeded with submitted questions

**Deck guidelines:**
- Maximum 20-25 slides for a 60-minute session
- One idea per slide -- no walls of text
- Use data visualizations over tables
- Include verbatim customer quotes or employee stories
- End every section with "What this means for you" or "What we need from you"

### 2. CEO and Leadership Updates

**Frequency options:**
- Weekly pulse (3-5 paragraphs, Slack or email)
- Monthly recap (1-2 pages, email with intranet archive)
- Quarterly letter (2-3 pages, strategic reflection)

**Tone:** Personal, direct, honest. Write like a human, not a press release.

**Structure for recurring updates:**
1. **Lead with what matters most** -- the single most important thing
2. **Context and progress** -- how we are tracking, what changed, why it matters
3. **Spotlight** -- a person, team, or customer story that illustrates values in action
4. **Looking ahead** -- what is coming and what the team should focus on
5. **Personal note** -- something authentic and human (lesson learned, gratitude, reflection)

### 3. Policy Change Announcements

**Sensitivity levels and approach:**

**Low sensitivity** (dress code update, new tool, schedule change):
- Direct announcement via email or Slack
- Lead with the change, then explain the why
- Provide FAQ if questions are anticipated
- Effective date and any required actions

**Medium sensitivity** (benefits changes, reporting structure, office policy):
- Manager cascade first, then all-employee communication
- Lead with the why and context before the what
- Acknowledge impact on employees directly
- Provide clear timeline, FAQ, and who to contact
- Follow up with Q&A session if needed

**High sensitivity** (layoffs, major restructuring, compensation changes):
- Leadership alignment and message approval first
- Live announcement (town hall or team meetings) before written follow-up
- Lead with empathy and honesty about the situation
- Provide specifics -- vague communication breeds anxiety
- Detailed FAQ, support resources, and next steps
- Multiple follow-up touchpoints over days and weeks

### 4. Team and Hire Announcements

**New hire announcement template:**
- Name, role, team, start date
- Brief professional background (2-3 sentences)
- Personal touch -- hobby, fun fact, or what excited them about joining
- How the team can welcome them (Slack channel, lunch, onboarding buddy)
- Photo (with their permission)

**Promotion announcement template:**
- Name, new role, previous role
- Specific accomplishments that led to the promotion
- What they will be taking on in the new role
- Quote from their manager about their impact
- Encouragement for the team to congratulate them

**Departure announcement template:**
- Name, role, last day
- Brief acknowledgment of their contributions (specific, not generic)
- Transition plan -- who is covering their responsibilities
- How to connect if they want to stay in touch (with departing employee's permission)
- Keep it warm and professional regardless of circumstances

### 5. Culture and Values Content

**Formats:**
- Employee spotlight stories (intranet or newsletter)
- Values-in-action features (specific examples of values being lived)
- Team or project retrospectives
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion updates
- Community involvement and volunteering recaps
- Learning and development highlights
- Wellness and work-life content

**Writing principles for culture content:**
- Show, do not tell -- use specific stories, not abstract claims
- Feature diverse voices across levels, teams, and locations
- Connect cultural moments to business impact when possible
- Avoid corporate speak -- write like a real person talking to a colleague
- Make it participatory -- invite contributions, reactions, and conversation

### 6. Change Management Communications

**Communication cadence for major changes:**

**Pre-announcement (2-4 weeks before):**
- Leadership alignment on messaging and rationale
- Manager toolkit development (talking points, FAQ, scenarios)
- Identify change champions in each team

**Announcement (Day 0):**
- Live communication from senior leader
- Written follow-up within 2 hours
- Manager one-on-ones with directly affected employees
- FAQ published on intranet

**Week 1-2 post-announcement:**
- Daily check-in availability from leadership
- Manager office hours
- Feedback channel (anonymous option available)
- Clarification updates as questions surface

**Month 1-3 post-announcement:**
- Weekly progress updates
- Milestone celebrations
- Adjust messaging based on feedback and adoption data
- Retrospective on communication effectiveness

### 7. Crisis Internal Communications

**Principles:**
- Speed matters -- communicate early, even if incomplete
- Honesty over polish -- admit what you do not know
- Employee safety and wellbeing come first
- Consistent updates on a stated cadence (even if there is no new information)
- Designate a single source of truth

**Crisis communication template:**
1. What happened (facts only, no speculation)
2. What we are doing about it (immediate actions taken)
3. What this means for employees (safety, work, expectations)
4. What we know and do not know yet
5. When the next update will come
6. Who to contact for questions or support

## Tone and Voice Guidelines

### Core Principles

- **Transparent**: Share the why, not just the what. Do not hide behind corporate language.
- **Inclusive**: Write for all employees -- every level, location, and background.
- **Human**: Use first person, contractions, and natural sentence structure.
- **Respectful**: Acknowledge impact on people. Never minimize legitimate concerns.
- **Action-oriented**: Every communication should make clear what employees should do, know, or feel.

### Language to Use

- "We" and "our team" (collective ownership)
- "Here is what we know" (transparency)
- "This affects you because" (relevance)
- "Your feedback matters" (invitation)
- "We got this wrong" or "We are still figuring this out" (honesty)

### Language to Avoid

- Corporate jargon: "synergize," "leverage," "circle back," "move the needle"
- Passive voice that obscures responsibility: "A decision was made" -- say who decided
- Minimizing language: "minor adjustment" for something that significantly affects people
- Empty superlatives: "incredibly excited," "thrilled to announce" -- especially for neutral news
- "Please do not hesitate to reach out" -- just say "email [person] with questions"

## Channel Selection Guide

| Channel | Best For | Tone | Urgency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email | Formal announcements, policy changes, detailed updates | Professional, thorough | Medium |
| Slack/Teams | Quick updates, celebrations, informal FYIs | Conversational, brief | Low-Medium |
| Town hall | Strategic updates, major announcements, Q&A | Engaged, personal | Medium-High |
| Intranet | Reference content, FAQs, evergreen resources | Clear, structured | Low |
| Video message | Leadership updates, emotional topics, remote teams | Warm, authentic | Medium |
| Manager cascade | Sensitive changes, individual impact, nuanced topics | Empathetic, direct | High |
| One-on-one | Terminations, performance, role changes | Private, compassionate | High |

## Cascade Planning

For communications that require coordination across multiple channels and audiences:

**Step 1: Map stakeholders by impact level**
- Directly affected (hear first, hear in person)
- Indirectly affected (hear second, hear from their manager)
- General population (hear third, hear via broad channel)

**Step 2: Build the cascade timeline**
- Board or executive team (if applicable)
- Senior leadership (aligned on message)
- People managers (equipped with talking points and FAQ)
- Directly affected employees (live conversation)
- All employees (broad announcement)
- External stakeholders (if applicable)

**Step 3: Equip each cascade level**
- Talking points (what to say, what not to say)
- FAQ (anticipated questions with approved answers)
- Escalation path (who to send tough questions to)
- Timeline (when they can share, when the broad announcement goes out)

## Message Framework by Sensitivity

**Routine (celebrations, FYIs, updates):**
- Lead with the news
- Add context or color
- Include any action items or links
- Keep it brief and energetic

**Moderate (changes that affect workflows or teams):**
- Lead with the why
- Explain the what clearly
- Acknowledge impact
- Provide timeline and next steps
- Point to resources and contacts

**Sensitive (restructuring, layoffs, leadership changes):**
- Lead with empathy and acknowledgment
- Provide honest context
- Be specific -- vague language increases anxiety
- Outline support and resources
- Commit to follow-up and ongoing communication
- Allow space for questions and emotions
