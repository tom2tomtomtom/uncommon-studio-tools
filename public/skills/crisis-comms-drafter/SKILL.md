# Crisis Comms Drafter

In crisis, speed and consistency matter. Draft communications that protect reputation while maintaining trust through transparency.

## Core Principles

1. **Acknowledge quickly** — Silence is interpreted as guilt or incompetence
2. **Express appropriate concern** — Lead with people, not process
3. **State facts only** — Never speculate or assign blame
4. **Commit to action** — Explain what you're doing, not just what happened
5. **Centralise messaging** — One voice, consistent across channels

## Holding Statement Framework

Use when: Issue has emerged but full facts unknown.

### Structure

```
[Opening: Acknowledge + express concern]
[What we know: Confirmed facts only]
[What we're doing: Immediate actions]
[Commitment: Next update timing]
[Contact: Media enquiries direction]
```

### Template

```
[Client] is aware of [brief, neutral description of issue].

[Expression of concern appropriate to severity — e.g., "Our first priority is the safety and wellbeing of..." or "We take this matter seriously..."]

We are [immediate action — e.g., "working with authorities", "conducting a thorough investigation", "in contact with affected parties"].

We will provide a further update [timeframe — e.g., "within the next [X] hours", "as soon as more information is confirmed"].

For media enquiries, please contact [name] on [mobile/email].
```

### Severity Calibration

**High severity** (safety, legal, significant harm):
- Lead with empathy and concern
- Active voice, personal accountability
- CEO or senior spokesperson attribution

**Medium severity** (operational, reputational):
- Professional and measured tone
- Focus on resolution
- Appropriate spokesperson level

**Low severity** (minor disruption, clarification):
- Straightforward, factual
- Solution-focused
- May not require attribution

## Stakeholder-Specific Messaging

Different audiences need tailored communications:

### Employees
- Inform before external announcement when possible
- Be honest about what's known and unknown
- Provide clear direction on how to respond to questions
- Acknowledge their concerns

### Customers
- Lead with impact on them
- Clear information on what to do
- Accessible contact for questions
- Demonstrate you're taking action

### Media
- Facts only, no speculation
- Spokesperson availability
- Commitment to transparency
- Clear timeline for updates

### Partners/Suppliers
- Professional, measured tone
- Focus on continuity
- Direct contact for concerns

### Investors/Board
- Full factual briefing
- Risk assessment
- Mitigation actions
- Regulatory considerations

## Escalation Framework

### Level 1: Monitor
- Issue identified but contained
- Prepare holding statement
- Brief key spokespeople
- Establish monitoring

### Level 2: Respond
- Issue gaining traction
- Activate holding statement
- Proactive stakeholder outreach
- Media monitoring intensified

### Level 3: Manage
- Significant reputational risk
- Senior spokesperson deployed
- Stakeholder briefings active
- Real-time response coordination

### Level 4: Crisis
- Major reputational/operational impact
- CEO-level response
- Crisis team fully activated
- Board/legal involvement

## Key Messages Development

For each crisis, establish:

**Primary message** (the one thing to communicate):
- [Single, clear statement of position]

**Supporting messages** (proof points):
- [What we're doing]
- [Why this matters to us]
- [How we'll prevent recurrence]

**Bridge phrases** (to redirect questions):
- "What I can tell you is..."
- "The important thing right now is..."
- "We're focused on..."
