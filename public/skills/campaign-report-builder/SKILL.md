# Campaign Report Builder

This skill generates comprehensive end-of-campaign performance reports for Uncommon Studio clients. It transforms raw campaign data into structured, insight-driven reports that demonstrate value, surface learnings, and provide actionable recommendations for future work. Reports are designed to be presentation-ready and suitable for sharing with client leadership.

## When to Use

- A campaign has concluded and the client needs a performance summary
- A campaign phase has ended and a mid-flight or interim report is needed
- You need to compile multi-channel results into a single narrative
- Quarterly or annual performance rollups are required
- You are preparing for a client review meeting and need a structured deck

## Report Structure

Every campaign report should follow this sequence. Adjust depth based on campaign complexity and client expectations.

### 1. Executive Summary

Write 3-5 sentences that answer: What did we do, how did it perform, and what should we do next? This section is for the person who will only read one paragraph. Lead with the strongest result.

Template:
"[Campaign Name] ran from [start] to [end] across [channels]. The campaign delivered [top-line result] against a target of [KPI target], representing a [percentage] [over/under] performance. [One sentence on strongest channel or creative insight]. We recommend [primary next step]."

### 2. Campaign Overview

Summarize the campaign parameters:

- **Campaign name and flight dates**
- **Objective** -- what the campaign was designed to achieve
- **Target audience** -- who we were reaching
- **Channels deployed** -- list all channels with brief role of each
- **Total investment** -- media spend, production costs, agency fees
- **Key KPIs** -- the metrics the campaign was measured against

### 3. Results vs KPIs Table

Present a clear comparison table. Always include target, actual, and variance.

| KPI | Target | Actual | Variance | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Impressions | 5,000,000 | 6,200,000 | +24% | Exceeded |
| CTR | 1.2% | 1.45% | +21% | Exceeded |
| Conversions | 500 | 430 | -14% | Below Target |
| CPA | $45 | $52 | +16% | Below Target |
| ROAS | 4.0x | 3.7x | -8% | Near Target |

Status categories: Exceeded (>10% over), Met (within 10%), Near Target (10-20% under), Below Target (>20% under).

### 4. Channel-by-Channel Performance

For each channel, provide:

- **Spend and share of total budget**
- **Key metrics** specific to that channel
- **Performance vs channel-specific benchmarks**
- **What worked** -- top-performing tactics, placements, or formats
- **What underperformed** -- areas that did not meet expectations
- **Optimization actions taken** -- what was adjusted mid-flight

Cover channels in order of budget allocation. Common channels include:

- Paid Social (Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest)
- Paid Search (Google, Bing)
- Programmatic Display and Video
- Connected TV / OTT
- Email and CRM
- Organic Social
- Out of Home
- Print and Direct Mail

### 5. Creative Performance Analysis

Break down performance by creative asset, format, and message:

- **Top-performing creatives** -- which ads, subject lines, or assets drove the best results
- **Format comparison** -- static vs video vs carousel vs interactive
- **Message testing results** -- which value propositions or CTAs resonated
- **Audience-creative intersection** -- which creatives worked best for which segments
- **Fatigue indicators** -- did frequency or duration degrade performance

Include screenshots or thumbnails of top and bottom performers when possible.

### 6. Audience Insights

Summarize what was learned about the target audience:

- **Demographic performance** -- age, gender, income, geography breakdowns
- **Behavioral signals** -- interests, browsing patterns, device preferences
- **Audience segment comparison** -- prospecting vs retargeting vs lookalike
- **New audience opportunities** -- segments that over-indexed unexpectedly
- **Exclusion recommendations** -- segments to deprioritize going forward

### 7. Budget Performance

Provide a financial reconciliation:

- **Planned vs actual spend** by channel
- **Cost efficiency metrics** -- CPM, CPC, CPA, CPLPV trends over time
- **Pacing notes** -- was budget spent evenly or front/back-loaded
- **Reallocation summary** -- any mid-flight budget shifts and rationale

### 8. Key Learnings

Distill 5-8 actionable insights. Each learning should follow this format:

"**[Learning title]**: [What we observed]. [Why it matters]. [What to do about it]."

Example: "**Video outperformed static 3:1 on Meta**: 15-second video ads drove a 1.8% CTR vs 0.6% for static across all audience segments. This suggests our audience responds better to motion and storytelling. Recommend leading with video in all future Meta campaigns."

### 9. Recommendations for Next Campaign

Provide 3-5 prioritized recommendations with clear rationale:

- **Channel mix adjustments** -- shift budget toward what worked
- **Creative direction** -- formats, messages, and styles to pursue
- **Audience strategy** -- segments to expand, refine, or drop
- **Testing roadmap** -- what to test next and how to structure tests
- **Budget considerations** -- recommended investment level and allocation

## Benchmarking Approaches

When comparing results, layer in context:

- **Historical benchmarks** -- compare to the client's previous campaigns
- **Industry benchmarks** -- use published data for the client's vertical
- **Platform benchmarks** -- compare to channel-specific norms
- **Internal benchmarks** -- compare to Uncommon Studio portfolio averages

Always cite the source and timeframe of any benchmark used.

## Reporting by Campaign Type

### Brand Awareness Campaigns
Emphasize reach, frequency, brand lift, video completion rates, and share of voice. De-emphasize direct response metrics.

### Lead Generation Campaigns
Focus on volume, quality (MQL/SQL rates), cost per lead, and pipeline contribution. Include funnel stage analysis.

### E-Commerce / Direct Response Campaigns
Lead with ROAS, revenue, conversion rate, AOV, and CPA. Include product-level performance if applicable.

### Retention / Loyalty Campaigns
Report on repeat purchase rate, customer lifetime value impact, churn reduction, and engagement metrics.

## Data Visualization Guidance

- Use bar charts for channel comparisons
- Use line charts for performance over time
- Use tables for KPI scorecards
- Use pie/donut charts sparingly -- only for budget or channel mix shares
- Always label axes, include legends, and use consistent color coding
- Use the client's brand colors when possible
- Annotate charts with key events (campaign launch, optimization changes, external factors)

## Output Template

When generating a report, produce content in this order:

1. Report title and date range
2. Executive summary (3-5 sentences)
3. Campaign overview section
4. Results vs KPIs table
5. Channel performance sections (one per channel)
6. Creative performance analysis
7. Audience insights
8. Budget reconciliation
9. Key learnings (5-8 bullets)
10. Recommendations (3-5 prioritized)
11. Appendix with detailed data tables if needed

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering the report, verify:

- [ ] All numbers are internally consistent (totals match, percentages add up)
- [ ] Every KPI from the brief is addressed in the results table
- [ ] Variance is calculated correctly (actual vs target, not reverse)
- [ ] Channel sections cover all deployed channels -- none are missing
- [ ] Recommendations are supported by data presented in the report
- [ ] No jargon is used without definition for the client audience
- [ ] Executive summary can stand alone as a complete narrative
- [ ] Report uses consistent formatting, date formats, and number styles
- [ ] Client and campaign names are spelled correctly throughout
- [ ] All benchmarks cite their source and timeframe
- [ ] Budget reconciliation matches actual invoiced amounts
- [ ] Report has been reviewed for tone -- confident but honest about underperformance
