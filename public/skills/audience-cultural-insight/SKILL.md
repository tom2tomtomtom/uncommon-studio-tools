# Audience & Cultural Insight

Understand people beyond demographics. Find the cultural truths and tensions that unlock creative opportunity and genuine connection.

## Alt/Shift Approach

We bring behavioural science to cultural insight. We don't just describe audiences — we understand what drives their behaviour and how to shift it.

## Audience Research Framework

### Demographic Foundation

**Core demographics**:
- Age range
- Gender
- Location (specific markets)
- Income/socioeconomic
- Education level
- Occupation type
- Life stage (student, early career, parent, etc.)

**Demographic sizing**: Estimate audience size from census/ABS data or industry research.

### Psychographic Depth

**Values**: What matters most to them?
- Core beliefs
- Priorities in life
- What they stand for/against

**Attitudes**: How do they think?
- Outlook on life (optimistic/pragmatic/cautious)
- Attitude to category
- Attitude to brands/advertising
- Trust levels and skepticism

**Lifestyle**: How do they live?
- How they spend time
- How they spend money
- Media consumption habits
- Social behaviours

**Aspirations**: What do they want?
- Goals and ambitions
- Ideal self-image
- Status markers that matter

**Fears and frustrations**: What do they avoid?
- Anxieties and concerns
- Pain points in category
- What they're trying to escape

### Behavioural Analysis

**Category behaviours**:
- Current usage patterns
- Purchase frequency
- Decision journey
- Triggers and barriers
- Brand loyalty/switching

**Media behaviours**:
- Platform preferences by purpose
- Content consumption patterns
- Influencers and voices they trust
- Peak engagement times

**Decision-making style**:
- Rational vs. emotional drivers
- Research depth before purchase
- Influence of others
- Risk tolerance

### Audience Personas

Create 2-3 personas representing key segments:

**Persona Template**:
```
[NAME], [Age]

WHO THEY ARE
[One paragraph demographic and life context]

WHAT DRIVES THEM
• [Key motivation]
• [Key motivation]
• [Key motivation]

WHAT FRUSTRATES THEM
• [Pain point]
• [Pain point]

THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH [CATEGORY]
[How they currently engage]

HOW TO REACH THEM
[Channels, messages, moments]

QUOTE THAT CAPTURES THEM
"[Something they might say that reveals insight]"
```

## Cultural Insight Framework

### Cultural Moment Identification

**Moment types**:
- **Calendar moments**: Holidays, seasons, cultural dates
- **Cultural events**: Awards, festivals, sporting events
- **Media moments**: TV finales, album drops, viral phenomena
- **Social moments**: Trending conversations, movements
- **Category moments**: Industry events, product launches

**Relevance assessment**:

| Moment | Date/Timing | Audience Relevance | Brand Fit | Participation Type |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| [Moment] | [When] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [Lead/Join/Observe] |

### Cultural Tension Identification

Find tensions that create opportunity:

**Tension format**: "[This] vs. [That]"

Examples:
- "Want to be healthy vs. Don't want to miss out"
- "Value sustainability vs. Prioritise convenience"
- "Seek authenticity vs. Curate perfect image"

**Good tensions**:
- Are genuinely felt by audience
- Create unmet needs
- Open creative possibilities
- Connect to brand truth

### Trend Analysis

**Emerging trends**:
- What's gaining momentum?
- Early signals vs. mainstream adoption
- Trajectory prediction

**Trend assessment**:

| Trend | Stage | Audience Relevance | Brand Opportunity | Longevity |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| [Trend] | [Emerging/Growing/Peak/Declining] | [High/Med/Low] | [Description] | [Short/Med/Long] |

### Cultural Relevance Mapping

Map brand/category to cultural territory:

**Permission to play**: Where can the brand credibly participate?
**Owned territory**: What cultural space does the brand already own?
**Aspirational territory**: Where could the brand stretch with credibility?
**Off-limits**: Where should the brand stay out?

## Research Methods

### Desk Research

**Data sources**:
- ABS Census data
- Roy Morgan, Nielsen
- Industry reports
- Academic research
- Think with Google, Meta IQ

**Social intelligence**:
- Social listening platforms
- Reddit community analysis
- Online forum conversations
- Comment section analysis

### Cultural Scanning

**Monitor**:
- Trend forecasting (WGSN, Stylus)
- Cultural commentary (The Conversation, Guardian Long Reads)
- Subculture platforms (TikTok trends, Discord communities)
- Creative industries (design, fashion, art, music)

### Behavioural Science Lens

Apply behavioural principles:
- **Loss aversion**: What are they afraid of losing?
- **Social proof**: Who influences their decisions?
- **Present bias**: Short-term vs. long-term thinking
- **Status**: What signals matter to them?
- **Cognitive load**: Decision fatigue and shortcuts

## Insight Development

### The Insight Format

Strong insight = [Observation] + [Motivation] + [Tension/Opportunity]

"[Audience] do/think [observable behaviour or belief] because [underlying motivation], but [tension or unmet need]."

### Insight Quality Test

- **True**: Supported by evidence
- **Fresh**: Not obvious or already known
- **Relevant**: Matters to audience
- **Actionable**: Creative can build on it
- **Human**: About people, not data
