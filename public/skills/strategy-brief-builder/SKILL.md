# Strategy Brief Builder

Transform loose inputs into structured strategic thinking. A good brief is the foundation of great creative and comms work.

## Alt/Shift Strategic Approach

We combine behavioural science with creative thinking. Every strategy should answer: "How does this shift behaviour?" Not just awareness — actual change.

## Brief Structure

### 1. Background & Context
**What this section answers**: Why are we doing this?

Include:
- Business situation and catalyst for this work
- Relevant market/category context
- Previous activity and learnings
- Current brand position

Keep it brief — only context that shapes the strategy.

### 2. Objectives

**What this section answers**: What does success look like?

**Business objective**: What the organisation needs to achieve
Example: "Increase market share in under-35 segment by 5%"

**Communications objective**: What comms needs to do to support that
Example: "Shift perception of brand from 'traditional' to 'modern and relevant'"

**Behavioural objective**: What we want people to do
Example: "Trial product within 30 days of campaign exposure"

Write objectives that are:
- Specific and measurable
- Achievable within scope
- Linked to clear KPIs

### 3. Target Audience

**What this section answers**: Who are we talking to?

**Primary audience**: The most important group to reach

Define using:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, income (be specific)
- **Psychographics**: Values, attitudes, lifestyle, motivations
- **Behaviours**: Current category behaviour, media consumption, decision triggers
- **Current relationship with brand**: Awareness, perception, usage

**Secondary audience(s)**: Other relevant groups

**Audience insight**: The human truth that unlocks creative opportunity
- What do they want that they're not getting?
- What tension exists in their relationship with the category?
- What belief can we challenge or build on?

### 4. The Insight

**What this section answers**: What human truth will we build on?

Format: [Audience] + [Tension/Truth] + [Opportunity]

Strong insights are:
- Based on genuine human truth, not data point
- Surprising yet recognisable ("I've never thought of it that way, but yes")
- Actionable — creative can build on it
- Not about the brand — about the audience

Example: "Young professionals feel overwhelmed by financial decisions and avoid them entirely — creating anxiety that grows over time. They don't need more information; they need permission to start small."

### 5. Strategic Proposition

**What this section answers**: What is our central idea?

The single-minded thought that guides all activity. Not a tagline — a strategic direction.

Format: "[Brand] will [shift in perception/behaviour] by [how we'll do it]"

Example: "We'll make financial confidence feel achievable by celebrating small wins, not big goals."

### 6. Key Messages

**What this section answers**: What do we need to communicate?

- **Primary message**: The one thing audiences must take away
- **Supporting messages**: Proof points (3-4 maximum)
- **Tone and manner**: How we'll say it

### 7. Channels & Approach

**What this section answers**: How will we reach them?

- Recommended channels with rationale
- Role of each channel in the journey
- Integration approach
- Phasing if applicable

### 8. Mandatories & Constraints

**What this section answers**: What are the non-negotiables?

- Brand guidelines requirements
- Legal/compliance considerations
- Budget parameters
- Timing constraints
- Approval processes

### 9. Success Measures

**What this section answers**: How will we know it worked?

KPIs linked back to objectives:
- Awareness metrics
- Engagement metrics
- Behavioural metrics
- Business metrics

Include benchmarks where available.

## Developing Insights

### Insight Sources
- Existing research and data
- Social listening and cultural observation
- Stakeholder interviews

### Insight Testing Questions
1. Is it true? (Evidence-based)
2. Is it fresh? (Not obvious)
3. Is it relevant? (Matters to audience)
4. Is it actionable? (Creative can use it)

### Common Insight Formats

**Tension format**: "They want [X] but [barrier]"
**Belief format**: "They believe [common assumption] but actually [reality]"
**Behaviour format**: "They do [behaviour] because [underlying motivation]"
