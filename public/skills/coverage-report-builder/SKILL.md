# Coverage Report Builder

Transform media coverage data into strategic insight. Reports should demonstrate value and inform future strategy — not just list clips.

## Report Structure

### Executive Summary

Lead with:
- Headline result (one sentence)
- Key metrics snapshot
- Strategic implications (2-3 bullet points)

Example:
"The campaign generated 47 pieces of coverage reaching an estimated audience of 12.4M, with 89% positive/neutral sentiment. Coverage strongly indexed toward target demographic through lifestyle and business media, with the sustainability angle driving highest engagement."

### Coverage Overview

**Quantitative snapshot**:
- Total pieces of coverage
- Total reach/circulation
- Media type breakdown (print, online, broadcast, podcast)
- Tier breakdown (Tier 1, 2, 3)

**Qualitative snapshot**:
- Sentiment breakdown (positive, neutral, negative)
- Message pull-through rate
- Key spokesperson visibility
- Competitive mentions

### Coverage Highlights

Feature 3-5 standout pieces:

For each:
- Publication + headline
- Reach/circulation
- Why it matters (tier, audience, message delivery)
- Link or clip reference

### Detailed Coverage List

| Date | Outlet | Headline | Type | Reach | Sentiment | Messages | Link |
|------|--------|----------|------|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| [Date] | [Outlet] | [Headline] | [Print/Online/Broadcast] | [Number] | [Pos/Neu/Neg] | [Y/N per key message] | [URL] |

### Sentiment Analysis

**Overall sentiment**: [X]% Positive | [X]% Neutral | [X]% Negative

**Sentiment drivers**:
- Positive coverage driven by: [themes, angles, messages]
- Negative coverage driven by: [issues, counter-narratives]
- Neutral coverage: [context — often news-straight reporting]

### Message Pull-Through

Track which key messages appeared in coverage:

| Key Message | Appearances | % of Coverage |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Message 1] | [#] | [%] |
| [Message 2] | [#] | [%] |
| [Message 3] | [#] | [%] |

Analyse:
- Which messages cut through?
- Which were underrepresented?
- Implications for future messaging

### Share of Voice (if applicable)

Compare coverage volume and quality against competitors:

| Brand | Coverage Count | Total Reach | Avg Sentiment |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Client | [#] | [#] | [Pos/Neu/Neg] |
| Competitor A | [#] | [#] | [Pos/Neu/Neg] |
| Competitor B | [#] | [#] | [Pos/Neu/Neg] |

### Insights & Recommendations

**What worked**:
- [Successful element + evidence]
- [Successful element + evidence]

**What to improve**:
- [Opportunity + recommendation]
- [Opportunity + recommendation]

**Strategic implications**:
- [Insight informing future activity]

## Measurement Frameworks

### Reach Metrics

**Circulation/Audience figures**:
- Source from media kit or monitoring platform
- Note whether print circulation, unique visitors, or broadcast audience
- Flag any estimates vs. verified figures

**Reach vs. Impressions**:
- Reach: Number of people potentially exposed
- Impressions: Total exposure instances (one person seeing twice = 2 impressions)
- Report both when available

### Moving Beyond AVE

Advertising Value Equivalent (AVE) is outdated and misleading. Instead:

**Qualitative value indicators**:
- Tier of publication (T1 = high credibility/reach)
- Message inclusion (did key messages appear?)
- Sentiment (positive coverage worth more than neutral)
- Positioning (headline, feature, or mention?)
- Call to action presence (did it drive audience action?)

**Alternative metrics**:
- Cost per meaningful coverage (PR spend ÷ quality placements)
- Message penetration rate (% of coverage including key messages)
- Share of voice in target outlets
- Engagement rates (for online coverage with social sharing)

### Sentiment Coding

**Positive**: Favourable framing, endorsement, recommendation, positive outcomes highlighted
**Neutral**: Factual reporting, balanced coverage, no clear favourability
**Negative**: Critical framing, problems highlighted, unfavourable context

When coding, consider:
- Headline tone
- Body copy framing
- Image/visual choices
- Prominence of negative vs. positive elements

### Quality Scoring

Rate each piece 1-5 across:
- Reach (circulation/audience)
- Relevance (target audience alignment)
- Messaging (key message inclusion)
- Positioning (prominence in piece)
- Sentiment

Weight by client priorities. Sum for total quality score.
