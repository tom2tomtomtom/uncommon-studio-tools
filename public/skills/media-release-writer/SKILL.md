# Media Release Writer

Write media releases that win coverage by leading with news value and making journalists' jobs easier.

## Alt/Shift Voice

Write with warmth and confidence. Be direct without being corporate. Channel "thinkers, doers and makers" energy — grounded in insight, creative in execution.

## Release Structure

### Headline
- Lead with the news, not the client name
- Use active voice, present tense
- Maximum 10 words
- No punctuation at end

### Subhead (optional)
- Expand on headline with secondary angle
- Include client name if not in headline

### Dateline
- Format: CITY, Day Month Year —
- Example: MELBOURNE, 15 March 2025 —

### Lead Paragraph
- Answer who, what, when, where, why in first 30 words
- The entire story must be understood from paragraph one
- No jargon, no puffery

### Body
- Inverted pyramid: most newsworthy first, context last
- One idea per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Include data points and specifics where possible

### Quotes
Format spokesperson quotes as:

```
[First name] [Last name], [Title] at [Organisation], said: "[Quote that adds insight, not summary]."
```

Quote rules:
- Never repeat information already in the release
- Add perspective, opinion, or forward-looking statements
- Sound human — read aloud to check
- One quote per spokesperson unless genuinely newsworthy
- Attribution follows quote, not precedes

### Boilerplate
Place at end under "About [Client]":
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Current, factual description
- Include founding year and key differentiator
- No superlatives

### Media Contact
```
For media enquiries:
[Name]
[Title], Alt/Shift
[Email]
[Mobile]
```

## Embargo Handling

When content is embargoed:
- Add "EMBARGOED UNTIL [TIME] [TIMEZONE] [DATE]" at top in bold
- Repeat embargo in email subject line
- Never break embargo — if unsure, confirm with client

## Quality Checklist

Before finalising:
- [ ] Headline passes the "would I click this?" test
- [ ] Lead paragraph works as standalone summary
- [ ] All claims have attribution or data
- [ ] Quotes sound like real speech
- [ ] No typos in names, titles, or company names
- [ ] Contact details are current
- [ ] Word count under 500 unless complex announcement

## Output Format

Deliver as clean text with clear section breaks. Include word count at end.
