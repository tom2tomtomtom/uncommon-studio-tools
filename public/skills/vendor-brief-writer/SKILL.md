# Vendor Brief Writer

This skill generates clear, professional briefs for external vendors and freelancers engaged by Uncommon Studio. A strong vendor brief eliminates ambiguity, reduces revision cycles, and protects both parties by documenting expectations upfront. Whether briefing a photographer, printer, developer, animator, or illustrator, this skill produces a complete brief ready to send.

## When to Use

- You are engaging an external photographer, videographer, or production crew
- A print job needs to be quoted and produced by a third-party printer
- A freelance developer, animator, or illustrator is being brought onto a project
- You need to formalize expectations with any external partner before work begins
- A vendor brief is required as part of the project documentation

## Vendor Brief Structure

### 1. Project Overview

Provide context so the vendor understands the bigger picture:

- **Project name**: [Name]
- **Client**: [Client name] -- [industry/description]
- **Agency**: Uncommon Studio
- **Brief date**: [Date]
- **Brief prepared by**: [Name, role, email, phone]
- **Project summary**: 3-5 sentences describing the overall project, the vendor's piece within it, and what the final output will be used for

The vendor should be able to read this section and understand where their work fits in the larger effort.

### 2. Background and Context

Give the vendor enough context to make informed creative and technical decisions:

- **Brand overview**: Brief description of the client's brand, tone, and visual identity
- **Campaign or project context**: What is this work supporting? A campaign launch, website redesign, product packaging, etc.
- **Target audience**: Who will see or interact with the final product
- **Competitive context**: Any relevant competitors or category norms to be aware of
- **Reference materials**: Links to brand guidelines, mood boards, previous work, or inspiration

Do not overwhelm with information. Include only what the vendor needs to do their job well.

### 3. Deliverables and Specifications

Be exhaustive in listing what the vendor must deliver. Ambiguity here leads to disputes and rework.

**Deliverable List**

| # | Deliverable | Specifications | Quantity |
|---|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | [Item] | [Detailed specs] | [Number] |
| 2 | [Item] | [Detailed specs] | [Number] |
| 3 | [Item] | [Detailed specs] | [Number] |

For each deliverable, include all relevant technical specifications (see vendor-specific sections below for detailed spec guidance).

### 4. Technical Requirements

Specify the technical parameters the vendor must meet:

- **File formats**: What formats are required for delivery (PSD, TIFF, MP4, etc.)
- **Resolution and dimensions**: Exact pixel dimensions, DPI, aspect ratios
- **Color space**: RGB, CMYK, Pantone references
- **File naming convention**: Required naming pattern for delivered files
- **Delivery method**: How files should be transferred (WeTransfer, Dropbox, FTP, hard drive)
- **Technical standards**: Any platform-specific requirements (broadcast specs, web performance, print bleed)

### 5. Timeline with Milestones

| Milestone | Date | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Brief issued | [Date] | Uncommon Studio |
| Vendor questions due | [Date] | Vendor |
| Estimate/quote due | [Date] | Vendor |
| Estimate approved | [Date] | Uncommon Studio |
| Production begins | [Date] | Vendor |
| First proof/draft/selects | [Date] | Vendor |
| Studio feedback | [Date] | Uncommon Studio |
| Revised deliverables | [Date] | Vendor |
| Final delivery | [Date] | Vendor |
| Payment | [Date/terms] | Uncommon Studio |

Flag any dates that are hard deadlines and cannot move. Note any dependencies on client approvals or other vendors.

### 6. Budget Parameters

Be transparent about budget to the degree appropriate:

- **Total budget for this scope**: $[amount] or "Budget range: $[low] -- $[high]"
- **What the budget must cover**: Itemize inclusions (labor, materials, travel, equipment, etc.)
- **What is excluded**: Items the studio will provide or pay for separately
- **Payment terms**: Net 30, milestone-based, deposit required, etc.
- **Expense policy**: Are expenses billed separately? Require pre-approval above $[threshold]?

If requesting a quote rather than working to a fixed budget, state: "Please provide an itemized estimate for the scope described above. Include all costs -- we prefer no surprises."

### 7. Usage Rights

Clearly define ownership and licensing:

- **Ownership**: Who owns the final deliverables and underlying assets
- **Usage scope**: Where and how the work will be used (geographic, media, duration)
- **Exclusivity**: Whether the vendor can use the work for self-promotion or resell elements
- **Model/talent releases**: Who is responsible for obtaining releases
- **Stock or licensed assets**: Policy on use of stock elements within the deliverables

See the Rights and Licensing Language section below for standard clauses.

### 8. Approval Process

Define the review workflow:

- **Number of revision rounds included**: [X] rounds
- **Who provides feedback**: [Name and role]
- **Feedback format**: Consolidated written feedback via [email/markup tool/project management tool]
- **Approval authority**: [Name] provides final written approval
- **Additional revisions**: Handled via change order at $[rate]/hour or per-revision fee

### 9. Contact Information

| Role | Name | Email | Phone |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| Project Manager (primary contact) | | | |
| Creative Director | | | |
| Client contact (if vendor will interact directly) | | | |
| Vendor primary contact | | | |

Specify who the vendor should contact for different types of questions (creative direction vs. logistics vs. billing).
