# Social Copy Writer

Write social content that earns engagement by matching platform conventions, audience expectations, and brand voice.

## Alt/Shift Voice on Social

Warm, clever, human. We're the interesting friend who knows things — not the brand account that shouts. Channel "win hearts and change minds" energy: lead with value, earn attention.

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### LinkedIn

**Character limits**: 3,000 (but aim for 150-300 for feed visibility)

**Tone**: Professional but not corporate. Thought leadership, not sales.

**Format**:
- Strong opening line (appears before "see more")
- Line breaks for readability
- Use white space strategically
- Emojis sparingly (0-2 per post)

**Best practices**:
- Lead with insight or provocation, not announcement
- Personal perspectives outperform corporate speak
- Ask questions that invite genuine discussion
- Tag individuals (not just company pages) for engagement
- Native content > link posts for reach

**Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant hashtags, placed at end

### Instagram

**Caption limits**: 2,200 characters (but first 125 visible before "more")

**Tone**: Warmer, more visual storytelling. Community-focused.

**Format**:
- Hook in first line (all users see this)
- Story arc: context → insight → CTA
- Emojis acceptable (match brand personality)
- Line breaks for scannability

**Best practices**:
- Caption should complement, not describe the image
- Include CTA (save, share, comment, link in bio)
- Reels and carousels outperform static for reach
- Stories for time-sensitive, behind-the-scenes

**Hashtags**: 5-15 relevant hashtags (mix of broad and niche)

### Twitter/X

**Character limits**: 280 per tweet, threads for longer content

**Tone**: Punchy, immediate, conversational. Hot takes welcome.

**Format**:
- One clear idea per tweet
- Threads: number posts (1/5, 2/5) or use visual hierarchy
- GIFs and images increase engagement

**Best practices**:
- First tweet must hook — it's the only one most see
- News and real-time commentary perform well
- Quote tweets with added value > basic retweets
- Engage in replies to build community

**Hashtags**: 1-2 maximum, only if highly relevant

### Facebook

**Character limits**: 63,206 (but optimal is 40-80 words)

**Tone**: Accessible, community-oriented, conversational.

**Format**:
- Shorter posts outperform longer
- Questions drive comments
- Video native preferred over YouTube links

**Best practices**:
- Community building over broadcasting
- Share content that sparks conversation
- Events and groups for deeper engagement
- Facebook-native video prioritised by algorithm

**Hashtags**: Optional, 1-2 if used

### TikTok

**Caption limits**: 2,200 characters

**Tone**: Authentic, entertaining, trend-aware. Self-aware humour works.

**Format**:
- Caption supplements video, doesn't repeat it
- Hook in video first 2 seconds
- Trending sounds increase discoverability

**Best practices**:
- Trends matter — participate authentically
- Behind-the-scenes and personality content
- Education disguised as entertainment
- User-generated content and duets

**Hashtags**: 3-5, including trending + niche

## Brand Voice Calibration

Before writing, confirm:
- Client's overall tone (formal ↔ casual)
- Emoji usage (never ↔ frequently)
- Hashtag style (branded, trending, topical)
- CTA preferences (soft vs. direct)
- Any prohibited language or topics

Apply client voice while maintaining platform conventions.

## Copy Structures

### Announcement
[What's happening] + [Why it matters] + [CTA]

### Thought Leadership
[Observation/insight] + [Perspective/take] + [Question or invitation]

### Behind-the-Scenes
[Context] + [Story moment] + [Connection to audience]

### Promotional
[Hook/problem] + [Solution/value] + [Clear CTA]

### Engagement Driver
[Question or prompt] + [Context if needed] + [Invitation to respond]

## Hashtag Strategy

**Branded**: #ClientCampaignName (use for tracking, not reach)
**Industry**: #MarketingTips, #RetailTech (moderate reach)
**Trending**: Current events, cultural moments (high reach, low longevity)
**Community**: Niche tags where target audience is active

Research before using — check tag isn't hijacked or associated with unwanted content.

## CTA Library

**Soft CTAs**:
- "What do you think?"
- "Has anyone else experienced this?"
- "Tag someone who needs to see this"

**Direct CTAs**:
- "Link in bio to learn more"
- "Comment [word] for the guide"
- "Save this for later"
- "Share with your team"

**Conversion CTAs**:
- "Register now — link in bio"
- "Limited spots — sign up today"
- "DM us to chat"
