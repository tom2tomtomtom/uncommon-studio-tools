# Client Comms Writer

Write client communications that build trust, demonstrate value, and keep projects moving. Be the agency that's easy to work with.

## Alt/Shift Client Voice

Professional but warm. Confident but not arrogant. We're partners, not suppliers. Write like you're updating a respected colleague — direct, clear, helpful.

## Communication Types

### Status Update Email

Use for: Regular project updates, weekly WIP, progress reports

**Structure**:
```
Subject: [Client/Project] — [Week/Period] Update

Hi [Name],

[One-sentence summary of where we're at]

PROGRESS THIS WEEK

• [Completed item + outcome]

• [Upcoming milestone]

NEEDS FROM YOU
• [Specific ask + deadline]
• [Specific ask + deadline]

[Optional: Flag any blockers or concerns]

Happy to jump on a call if anything needs clarification.

[Sign-off]
```

**Writing rules**:
- Lead with the headline — where are we overall?
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Be specific: "Draft media release" → "Media release for April launch — first draft complete, awaiting your review"
- Include timelines and next steps
- Always include "needs from you" section (even if empty: "Nothing needed from you this week")

## Tone Calibration

**Formal clients**: More structure, less casual language, professional sign-offs
**Collaborative clients**: Warmer tone, first names, conversational style
**New clients**: Slightly more formal until relationship established

## Common Situations

### Delivering Good News
Lead with the result. Be enthusiastic but professional. Credit the team effort (including client).

### Delivering Bad News
Don't bury it. State clearly, explain why, present solution or path forward. Take accountability where appropriate.

### Chasing Approvals
Be direct but not naggy. Explain why timing matters. Make it easy for them to respond.

Example: "Just checking in on the media release — we'll need sign-off by EOD Thursday to hit the Monday embargo. Happy for a quick call if you'd like to talk through anything."

### Handling Delays (Our Side)
Acknowledge early. Explain impact. Present revised timeline. Don't over-apologise.

Example: "Heads up — we're running behind on the content calendar. New timeline is Friday instead of Wednesday. This won't impact the campaign launch. Let me know if that creates any issues your end."

## Formatting Standards

- **Subject lines**: Always include client/project name for filterability
- **Greeting**: "Hi [Name]" (not "Dear" unless very formal client)
- **Sign-off**: "Thanks" / "Cheers" / "Speak soon" (match client's style)
- **Signature**: Include name, role, mobile
- **Length**: As short as possible while being complete
- **Attachments**: Reference in body, name files clearly

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Clear subject line with project reference
- [ ] Opens with summary/headline
- [ ] Action items have owners and deadlines
- [ ] Client's required actions are explicit
- [ ] Tone matches client relationship
- [ ] Proofread for typos and name spellings
- [ ] Attachments mentioned are attached
