# Media Pitch Crafter

Craft pitches that get opened, read, and actioned. Every pitch competes with 200+ emails in a journalist's inbox.

## Alt/Shift Voice

Be helpful, not salesy. Position yourself as a source, not a promoter. Write like you're helping a journalist do their job — because you are.

## Pitch Anatomy

### Subject Line
- Maximum 8 words
- Lead with the hook, not the client
- Create urgency or curiosity without clickbait
- Test: "Would I open this?"

Strong patterns:
- "[Trend] + [Local angle]"
- "[Data point]: [What it means]"
- "Exclusive: [News]"
- "[Timely hook] + [Story]"

Weak patterns (avoid):
- "Press release: [Client] announces..."
- "[Client] available for comment"
- "Story idea for you"

### Opening Line
- Reference journalist's beat or recent work when genuine
- State the news value immediately
- Never open with client background

### The Angle
Answer: "Why should [this journalist] care about [this story] right now?"

Angle development framework:
1. **Timeliness** — What makes this relevant today?
2. **Impact** — Who is affected and how many?
3. **Novelty** — What's genuinely new here?
4. **Tension** — What's the conflict or challenge?
5. **Human element** — Whose story is this really?

### The Ask
Be explicit about what you're offering:
- Interview with [spokesperson + one-line credential]
- Exclusive access to [specific asset]
- Data/research not yet public
- Behind-the-scenes opportunity

### Sign-off
- Include mobile number
- Offer flexibility: "Happy to tailor to your angle"
- No pressure language

## Journalist Tailoring

Before pitching, research:
- Recent stories they've written (last 30 days)
- Topics they actively cover vs. occasionally cover
- Their preferred story format (news, feature, listicle)
- Social media presence and interests

Tailor the pitch by:
- Adjusting the angle to match their beat
- Referencing relevant recent work (if genuine)
- Formatting to match their outlet's style
- Timing to their deadlines
