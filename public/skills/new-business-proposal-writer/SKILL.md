# New Business Proposal Writer

Write proposals that win business by demonstrating understanding, building confidence, and making the decision easy.

## Alt/Shift Proposal Voice

Confident but not arrogant. Smart but accessible. We're "thinkers, doers and makers" — show strategic depth and creative ambition. Behavioural science is our differentiator; weave it in where relevant.

## Proposal Structure

### 1. Cover/Title
- Client name
- Project/opportunity name
- Alt/Shift logo
- Date
- "Prepared for [Client]"

### 2. Executive Summary
One page maximum. Hit these points:

**Understanding**: Demonstrate you get their challenge
**Approach**: Your strategic perspective in one paragraph
**Why Alt/Shift**: Your unfair advantage for this work
**Investment**: Total fee (or range)

This page should make them want to read on — or, if they read nothing else, still understand your proposition.

### 3. Situation Understanding

Show you've done the work:
- The business context and challenge
- Market/competitive dynamics
- What success looks like for them
- Risks and opportunities you've identified

**Critical**: Reflect their language back to them. Use terms and phrases from the brief and any conversations.

### 4. Strategic Approach

Your recommended way forward:

**The insight**: What human or market truth will you build on?
**The strategy**: How you'll address the challenge
**The idea** (if applicable): Creative concept or approach

Show your thinking, not just your plan. Clients buy strategic confidence.

### 5. Scope of Work

Clear, specific deliverables:

| Phase | Deliverables | Timeline |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1. Discovery | [Specific outputs] | [Weeks/dates] |
| 2. Strategy | [Specific outputs] | [Weeks/dates] |
| 3. Execution | [Specific outputs] | [Weeks/dates] |

For each deliverable, be specific:
- What you'll deliver (format, length)
- What's included (rounds of revision, etc.)
- What's not included (prevent scope creep)

### 6. Team

Introduce the humans behind the work:

**Project Lead**: [Name], [Title]
[One paragraph on relevant experience and why they're right for this]

**Key Team Members**: [Names and roles]
[Brief credentials relevant to this project]

Include photos. Clients buy from people.

### 7. Case Studies

2-3 relevant examples proving you can do this:

**Case study format**:
```
[Client Name] — [Project Type]

THE CHALLENGE
[2-3 sentences: what they needed]

THE APPROACH
[2-3 sentences: what we did strategically]

THE RESULTS
[Specific metrics and outcomes]
[Pull quote from client if available]
```

Select cases that:
- Show relevant capability
- Demonstrate results
- Match the prospect's sector or challenge type

### 8. Investment

Present fees clearly:

**Option format** (if offering tiers):
| Option | Scope | Investment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Core | [What's included] | $XX,XXX |
| Recommended | [What's included] | $XX,XXX |
| Premium | [What's included] | $XX,XXX |

**Single proposal format**:
| Item | Investment |
|------|------------|
| [Phase/deliverable] | $XX,XXX |
| [Phase/deliverable] | $XX,XXX |
| **Total** | **$XX,XXX** |

**Fee notes**:
- Payment terms
- What's included (expenses, etc.)
- What's additional (travel, production, etc.)
- Validity period

### 9. Why Alt/Shift

Your credentials and differentiation:
- Award wins (relevant ones)
- Industry recognition
- Unique capabilities (behavioural science, integrated team)
- Client testimonials

Keep this section brief — it's proof, not pitch.

### 10. Terms & Next Steps

- Proposed timeline to start
- What you need from them to proceed
- Contract/T&C reference
- Contact for questions

## Proposal Principles

### Know Your Reader
- Who's the decision-maker? Tailor to them.
- Who else will read this? Address their concerns too.
- What do they value most? Lead with that.

### Show, Don't Tell
- "We're strategic" → Show strategic thinking
- "We deliver results" → Show specific results
- "We understand your audience" → Demonstrate audience insight

### Make It Easy
- Clear structure and navigation
- Scannable with headers and bullets
- Summary of key points upfront
- Obvious next steps

### Anticipate Objections
- Address concerns before they're raised
- Acknowledge risks with mitigation
- Handle "why not a bigger agency?" or "why not cheaper?" implicitly

## Capability Statement Format

For general credentials (not project-specific):

**Structure**:
1. Who we are (one paragraph)
2. What we do (services list)
3. Who we work with (client logos)
4. How we're different (key differentiators)
5. Selected work (3-4 case snapshots)
6. Contact

Keep to 4-6 pages maximum. This is an opener, not a closer.

## Case Study Formatting

**Full case study** (for website/detailed use):
- Challenge (context and problem)
- Insight (what we discovered)
- Strategy (our approach)
- Execution (what we did)
- Results (metrics and outcomes)
- Learnings (optional, for thought leadership)

**Case snapshot** (for proposals/creds):
- Challenge (one sentence)
- Approach (one sentence)
- Results (headline metrics)

**One-liner** (for lists):
"[Client]: [What we did] resulting in [key outcome]"
