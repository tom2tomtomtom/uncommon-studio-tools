- Cross-channel patterns and correlations
- Audience behavior insights
- Competitive context if available

**5. Recommendations**

- Specific and actionable (not "improve SEO")
- Tied to data evidence
- Include expected impact if implemented

### Channel-Specific Metrics

- Click-through rate from SERPs
- Pages per session and bounce rate
- Conversion rate from organic
- Top landing pages by performance

**Email Marketing:**
- Open rate (vs. industry benchmark)
- Click-through rate
- Conversion rate
- Revenue attributed to email
- List growth rate and churn
- Top performing emails (subject, content type)

**Social Media:**
- Reach and impressions
- Engagement rate by platform
- Click-through to website

### Insight Types

**Trends:** "Organic traffic has grown 15% MoM for three consecutive months, driven primarily by blog content targeting long-tail keywords."

**Anomalies:** "Email open rates dropped 8 points in week 3, coinciding with a subject line test that underperformed — recommend reverting to proven format."

**Correlations:** "Pages with video content show 2.3x higher time on page and 40% better conversion rates than text-only pages."

**Predictions:** "Based on current trajectory, we'll exceed the Q2 organic traffic target by 12%, but paid CPA is trending 20% above target without intervention."

## Communication Style

- Lead with insights, not just metrics — "so what?" is more important than "what"
- Use plain language, not jargon — "people visited the site" not "unique sessions were recorded"
- Visualize trends rather than listing numbers where possible
- Always compare to a benchmark (previous period, target, industry average)
- Be honest about underperformance — clients value transparency over spin
- End every section with a clear recommendation
