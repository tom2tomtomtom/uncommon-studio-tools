# Media List Intelligence

Build targeted media lists based on story fit, not just title matching. Quality over quantity — 10 well-matched journalists beat 100 spray-and-pray contacts.

## Research Framework

### Journalist Profile

For each potential contact, capture:

**Basics**
- Full name (correct spelling critical)
- Current outlet and title
- Beat/round (be specific: "retail" not just "business")
- Email and phone if available
- Social handles (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

**Story Fit**
- Recent relevant coverage (last 90 days)
- Story formats they prefer (news, features, interviews, analysis)
- Angle preferences (human interest, data-driven, trend pieces)
- Known interests outside core beat

**Practical**
- Deadline patterns (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Preferred contact method
- Response history (if known)
- Notes on previous interactions

### Beat Analysis

When analysing a journalist's beat:

1. **Review last 10-15 stories** they've published
2. **Identify patterns**: topics, sources quoted, story structures
3. **Note gaps**: areas they cover adjacent to your story
4. **Check social**: what they share, comment on, ask about
5. **Rate fit**: Strong / Medium / Low for this specific story

### Outlet Prioritisation

Tier media by story fit and client goals:

**Tier 1 — Primary Targets**
- Strongest beat match
- Highest impact for client objectives
- History of covering similar stories

**Tier 2 — Secondary Targets**
- Good beat match
- May require angle adjustment
- Solid reach for target audience

**Tier 3 — Opportunistic**
- Tangential fit
- Worth pitching if bandwidth allows
- May require significant angle tailoring

## List Building Process

### Step 1: Define Story Angle
Before researching, clarify:
- What's the core news?
- Who cares most about this?
- What's the ideal coverage outcome?

### Step 2: Identify Beat Categories
Map story to relevant beats:
- Primary beat (e.g., "retail technology")
- Adjacent beats (e.g., "supply chain", "consumer trends")
- Interest beats (e.g., "sustainability", "innovation")

### Step 3: Source Contacts
Pull from:
- Media database (Medianet, Isentia, Meltwater)
- Recent coverage search (Google News, outlet search)
- Social listening (Twitter/X lists, LinkedIn)
- Internal records (previous successful pitches)

### Step 4: Qualify and Tier
For each contact:
- Verify current role and outlet
- Review recent coverage
- Assess story fit
- Assign tier
- Add personalisation notes

### Step 5: Prioritise Outreach Order
Sequence based on:
- Exclusivity strategy (if applicable)
- Publication timing/deadlines
- Relationship strength
- Story fit confidence

## Output Format

Deliver media lists as structured tables:

| Priority | Name | Outlet | Beat | Email | Story Fit Notes | Personalisation Angle |
|----------|------|--------|------|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Tier 1 | [Name] | [Outlet] | [Beat] | [Email] | [Why they'll care] | [Recent work to reference] |

Include:
- List summary: total contacts by tier
- Recommended outreach sequence
- Exclusivity recommendations (if applicable)
- Gaps identified (beats with no strong contacts)

## Quality Standards

- Minimum 3 Tier 1 contacts per list (unless niche story)
- All emails verified within last 30 days
- No generic inboxes (news@, tips@) in Tier 1
- Every contact has a personalisation note
- Story fit notes are specific, not generic
