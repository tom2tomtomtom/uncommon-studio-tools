## Note-Taking Best Practices

### What to Capture

**Always capture**:
- Decisions made (exact wording matters)
- Action items with clear owners
- Deadlines mentioned
- Questions raised and answers given
- Concerns or risks flagged
- Commitments made

**Nice to capture**:
- Key discussion points (not verbatim)
- Context for decisions
- Alternatives considered
- Who said what (for significant points)

**Skip**:
- Off-topic chat
- Repetitive discussion
- Back-and-forth that led nowhere
- Administrative logistics (unless action required)

### Processing Raw Notes

When given unstructured notes:

1. **Identify decisions**: What was actually decided? (vs. discussed)
2. **Extract actions**: What needs to happen? Who owns it? When?
3. **Organise by topic**: Group related points together
4. **Clarify ambiguity**: Flag unclear items for follow-up
5. **Check completeness**: Are there obvious gaps?

### Action Item Standards

**Good action items are**:
- Specific: Clear what "done" looks like
- Owned: Single person accountable
- Time-bound: Deadline attached
- Achievable: Can be completed by one person

**Transform vague actions**:
- "Look into pricing" → "[Name] to research competitor pricing and share findings by [date]"
- "Follow up with client" → "[Name] to email [Client] re: approval by EOD [date]"
- "Sort out the website copy" → "[Name] to draft homepage copy; [Name] to review by [date]"

## Meeting Types

### Status/WIP Meetings
Focus on: Progress updates, blockers, upcoming priorities
Structure: By project or workstream

### Strategy/Planning Meetings
Focus on: Decisions, direction, resource allocation
Structure: By agenda topic

### Brainstorm/Workshop
Focus on: Ideas generated, themes identified, directions to explore
Structure: By creative territory or challenge

### Client Meetings
Focus on: Client feedback, decisions, commitments, next steps
Structure: Client-friendly, action-focused

### Team/Internal Meetings
Focus on: Coordination, problem-solving, alignment
Structure: By topic or team member

## Handling Common Challenges

### No Clear Decisions Made
Note as: "Discussed [topic] — no decision reached. To revisit [when/conditions]."

### No Deadlines Given
Default to: "By next meeting" or flag "Timeline TBC — [Owner] to confirm"

### No Clear Owner
Flag as: "Owner TBC" and note who needs to assign

### Conflicting Information
Note both positions: "[Name] suggested X; [Name] raised concerns about Y. Decision pending."

### Missing Information
Flag gaps: "Note: [Topic] not discussed — to address in follow-up"

## Distribution Best Practices

### Timing
- Same day for action-heavy meetings
- Next morning for complex discussions
- Before next meeting at latest

### Recipients
- All attendees
- Relevant stakeholders not present
- CC anyone assigned actions

### Format
- Email for external/client meetings
- Shared doc for ongoing project notes
- Project management tool for action tracking
