# Case Study Writer

This skill generates compelling client case studies for Uncommon Studio. Case studies are the studio's most powerful sales tool -- they demonstrate real results for real clients and provide social proof for prospective business. This skill produces case studies in multiple formats, from full-length website features to one-line summaries for proposal decks, all following the challenge-approach-results framework.

## When to Use

- A project has concluded with strong results worth showcasing
- You are preparing a proposal and need relevant case study references
- The studio website needs new portfolio content
- A pitch deck requires proof points from past work
- Award submissions need structured project narratives
- A client has agreed to be referenced and you need an approval-ready draft

## Case Study Structure -- Full Length

### 1. Headline

Write a headline that leads with the result, not the process. The headline should make someone want to read more.

**Formula**: [Result/Impact] + [For Whom] + [Through What]

Examples:
- "3x Return on Ad Spend for Heritage Outdoor Through Full-Funnel Video Strategy"
- "45% Increase in Qualified Leads for MedTech Startup After Brand Repositioning"
- "From Regional Player to National Brand: How River & Stone Scaled With a Digital-First Launch"

Avoid headlines that describe the work without the outcome (e.g., "Website Redesign for Tech Company").

### 2. Client and Industry Context

Provide a brief snapshot:

- **Client**: [Name] (use the name they have approved for use, or anonymize)
- **Industry**: [Sector]
- **Company size**: [Employees, revenue range, or market position -- if relevant]
- **Engagement type**: [Project-based / Retainer / Campaign]
- **Services provided**: [List of Uncommon Studio services used]
- **Timeline**: [Duration of engagement]

### 3. The Challenge

Describe the problem or opportunity that brought the client to Uncommon Studio. This section should create tension and make the reader curious about the solution.

Structure:
1. **Business context**: What was happening in the client's business or market
2. **Specific problem**: What was broken, missing, or underperforming
3. **Stakes**: What would happen if the problem was not solved
4. **Previous attempts**: What had the client tried before (if relevant)

Write from the client's perspective. Use language like "The client was facing..." rather than "We were hired to..."

Keep this section to 2-4 paragraphs. Be specific -- vague challenges produce vague case studies.

### 4. The Approach and Strategy

Explain the thinking behind the solution. This section demonstrates the studio's expertise and strategic depth.

Structure:
1. **Discovery and diagnosis**: What research or analysis was conducted to understand the problem
2. **Strategic insight**: The key realization or positioning decision that shaped the approach
3. **Solution framework**: The overall approach, broken into clear phases or pillars
4. **Why this approach**: Briefly explain why this strategy was chosen over alternatives

This section should show that the work was grounded in strategy, not just aesthetics. Prospective clients want to know that the studio thinks before it designs.

### 5. The Execution

Describe what was actually built, designed, launched, or delivered. This is where the visual and tactical details live.

Structure:
1. **Key deliverables**: What was produced (with brief descriptions)
2. **Creative decisions**: Notable design, copy, or technical choices and their rationale
3. **Channels and tactics**: Where and how the work was deployed
4. **Collaboration highlights**: Any notable aspects of the working process
5. **Challenges overcome**: Problems solved during execution (shows adaptability)

Keep this section concrete. Use specific numbers (e.g., "12 campaign assets across 4 formats" rather than "various creative deliverables").

### 6. The Results

This is the most important section. Lead with the strongest metric and support with secondary results.

**Primary result**: The headline metric that proves the work delivered value.

**Supporting results**: 3-5 additional metrics that round out the picture.

**Format each result as**:
- [Metric]: [Number] -- [Context that makes the number meaningful]

Examples:
- "Return on Ad Spend: 4.2x -- exceeding the 3.0x target by 40%"
- "Website conversion rate: 3.8% -- up from 1.2%, a 217% improvement"
- "Brand awareness: +18 points in aided recall within the target demographic"
- "Time to market: Launched 2 weeks ahead of schedule"

**Rules for writing results**:
- Always include the baseline or target for comparison
- Use percentages AND absolute numbers when possible
- Attribute results to the work -- explain the connection between action and outcome
- Be honest about timeframes ("within the first 90 days")
- If exact numbers cannot be shared, use ranges or relative improvements ("more than doubled")

### 7. Client Quote

Include a direct quote from the client contact. A strong quote:

- Speaks to the business impact, not just the aesthetics
- Mentions a specific aspect of working with the studio
- Comes from someone with a title the reader would respect

**Template for requesting a quote**:
"We would love to include a quote from you in our case study. It can be brief -- 2-3 sentences about the impact of the work or your experience working with our team. Here is a draft for your review and editing:

'[Draft quote based on known feedback]'

Please feel free to revise this to match your voice, or provide your own quote entirely."

Always get written approval for the exact wording used.

### 8. Key Takeaways

End with 2-3 transferable insights that demonstrate broader expertise:

- What principle or approach made this successful
- What other businesses can learn from this example
- What the studio learned that informs future work

These takeaways help prospective clients see how the studio's thinking could apply to their own challenges.

## Case Study Formats

### Full-Length (Website / Portfolio)

- 800-1,200 words
- All 8 sections above
- Accompanied by imagery (project screenshots, photography, data visualizations)
- Used on the studio website, in detailed proposals, and for award submissions

### Snapshot (Proposal Insert)

- 200-300 words
- Compressed format: Challenge (2-3 sentences), Approach (2-3 sentences), Results (bullet list)
- One client quote (optional)
- Used in proposals, pitch decks, and capability presentations

Template:
"**[Client Name] -- [Industry]**

[Challenge in 2-3 sentences]. Uncommon Studio [approach in 2-3 sentences].

**Results:**
- [Primary metric]
- [Secondary metric]
- [Tertiary metric]

*'[Client quote]'* -- [Name, Title]"

### One-Liner (List Format)

- 1-2 sentences
- Used in client lists, credential slides, and brief references

Template:
"**[Client Name]**: [What we did] resulting in [key metric]. ([Services provided])"

Example:
"**Heritage Outdoor**: Full-funnel video campaign resulting in 3x ROAS and 45% lift in brand awareness. (Strategy, Creative, Media)"

## Writing Compelling Results Sections

### Show the Before and After

Always provide context that makes numbers meaningful:
- Bad: "The campaign generated 10,000 leads."
- Good: "The campaign generated 10,000 qualified leads in 8 weeks -- 3x the volume of the client's previous best-performing campaign."

### Use Multiple Types of Metrics

Combine different categories to tell a complete story:
- **Business metrics**: Revenue, leads, conversions, ROAS, market share
- **Performance metrics**: CTR, engagement rate, cost per acquisition, conversion rate
- **Brand metrics**: Awareness, consideration, sentiment, NPS
- **Operational metrics**: Time to market, efficiency gains, cost savings
- **Qualitative outcomes**: Awards won, press coverage, internal adoption

### Handle Sensitive or Unavailable Data

When exact numbers cannot be shared:
- Use percentage improvements instead of absolute numbers
- Use ranges: "between $2M and $5M in attributed revenue"
- Use multipliers: "3x improvement over previous performance"
- Use relative terms with approval: "a significant increase in qualified pipeline"
- State what you can share: "While specific revenue figures are confidential, the campaign exceeded all performance targets"

## Getting Client Approval

### Approval Process

1. **Draft the case study** using available data and project knowledge
2. **Internal review** -- creative director and account lead review for accuracy and positioning
3. **Client review** -- send to the client contact with a clear ask:
   "Attached is a draft case study we would like to feature on our website and in proposals. Please review for factual accuracy and let us know if any information should be modified or removed. We are happy to anonymize if preferred."
4. **Revise based on feedback** -- address all client concerns
5. **Get written approval** -- email confirmation that the final version is approved for use
6. **Define usage scope** -- confirm where the case study can be used (website, proposals, social, press, awards)

### Common Client Concerns and Responses

- **"We cannot share exact numbers"** -- Offer percentages, ranges, or anonymized data
- **"Our legal team needs to review"** -- Provide the draft in an easily shareable format with a reasonable review timeline
- **"We would prefer to be anonymous"** -- Replace the company name with a description: "a leading SaaS company in the healthcare space"
- **"The timing is not right"** -- Respect the timeline and follow up in 3-6 months
- **"We need to approve the images too"** -- Include all imagery in the approval package

## Visual and Design Guidance

### Photography and Screenshots

- Lead with the strongest visual -- often the final product in context
- Show the work at multiple scales (full page, detail, in-environment)
- Use consistent image treatment (shadows, borders, backgrounds)
- Include before/after comparisons when the transformation is dramatic
- Show the work across devices if it is digital

### Data Visualization

- Use simple, clear charts for results -- bar charts or bold stat callouts
- Limit each visualization to one key message
- Use the client's brand colors or neutral studio colors
- Always label data clearly -- no ambiguous axes or missing legends
- Consider large-format stat callouts: "[number]% [description]" as a design element

### Layout Recommendations

- Hero image or project mockup at the top
- Challenge-Approach-Results as clear sections with headings
- Pull the strongest result into a large callout or highlight box
- Client quote styled distinctly from body text
- Supporting imagery woven between text sections
- Key takeaways styled as a closing module

## Output Template

3. Challenge (2-4 paragraphs)
4. Approach and strategy (2-3 paragraphs)
5. Execution (2-3 paragraphs with specific deliverables)
6. Results (primary metric + 3-5 supporting metrics)
7. Client quote (or placeholder for one)
8. Key takeaways (2-3 insights)
9. Snapshot version (200-300 word condensed version)
10. One-liner version (1-2 sentences)

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering the case study, verify:
