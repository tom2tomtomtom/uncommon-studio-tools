# /improvement-plan

Turn competitive research into a prioritized action plan for your app. Takes ~15 minutes.

## What this does
Analyzes competitor strengths across product, UX, messaging, and business strategy — then delivers specific, prioritized recommendations for improving your own app. Separates quick wins from strategic investments and flags what to protect vs. what to avoid.

## When to use
- You've been researching competitors and need to turn findings into actions
- Planning the next quarter's product improvements
- Leadership asks "what should we do differently?"
- After a competitive loss — figuring out what to fix
- Annual strategy planning with competitive context

## How to use
Share:
- Your product/app (name, URL, or description)
- Competitors you've been looking at (or ask Claude to research them)
- What's working well already (so recommendations build on strengths)
- Your constraints (team size, timeline, budget)
- What you're optimizing for (growth, retention, conversion, positioning)

## Example
```
/improvement-plan

Our app: InvoiceNinja (invoicing for freelancers) — invoiceninja.com
Competitors I've been watching: FreshBooks, Wave, Stripe Invoicing

What's working: Our core invoicing flow is fast and users love it
Constraints: 4-person dev team, no major redesign budget this quarter
Optimizing for: Reducing churn — users leave after ~6 months

Give me a realistic improvement plan based on what competitors do better.
