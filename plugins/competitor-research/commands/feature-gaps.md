# /feature-gaps

Find what competitors have that you don't — and what you have that they don't. Takes ~10 minutes.

## What this does
Compares product features, capabilities, and user experience across competitors to identify gaps, advantages, and whitespace opportunities. Categorizes each gap by user value and build effort.

## When to use
- Planning your product roadmap
- Evaluating build vs. buy decisions
- Client asks "why don't we have what they have?"
- Prioritizing what to build next
- Preparing competitive differentiation for a pitch

## How to use
Share:
- Your product/app and its current feature set (or URL)
- Competitors to compare against (names or URLs)
- Any specific areas to focus on (e.g., "integrations" or "mobile experience")
- What you're trying to decide (roadmap, pitch, strategy)

## Example
```

Our app: CloudEdit (browser-based design tool) — cloudedit.app
Current features: Vector editing, templates, real-time collaboration, brand kit

```

## What you'll get
- **Features they have, you don't** — Each rated by user value (high/medium/low) and build effort (low/medium/high)
- **Features you have, they don't** — Your existing advantages to protect
- **Features nobody has yet** — Whitespace opportunities for differentiation
- **Must-have vs. nice-to-have** — Which gaps are table stakes and which are differentiators
- **Prioritized build list** — Quick wins, strategic bets, and things to skip
