## Tips

- **Share your own product first** — Claude needs to understand both sides to make useful comparisons
- **Provide URLs when possible** — Real competitor sites give Claude concrete material to analyze
- **Be specific about your goal** — "Planning next quarter's roadmap" produces different recommendations than "preparing a pitch deck"
- **Start with `/landscape-map`** — It gives you the big picture, then drill into specifics with the other commands

## Optional Connectors

These let Claude access your tools directly (not required):
- **Slack** - Share findings with your team
- **Notion** - Store research in your workspace
- **Google Drive** - Save reports to shared drives

Set these up in **Settings → Connectors** if you want them.
