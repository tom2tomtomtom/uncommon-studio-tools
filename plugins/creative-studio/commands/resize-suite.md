# /resize-suite

Regenerate an image concept across multiple aspect ratios.

## What this does
Takes an existing image concept or prompt and regenerates it across multiple aspect ratios — adapting composition, framing, and focal points for each format. Not a crop — each version is composed specifically for its dimensions.

## When to use
- Have a hero image that needs to work across web, social, and mobile
- Need platform-specific versions of a campaign visual
- Adapting a concept for different ad placements (display, stories, feed)
- Creating responsive imagery that looks intentional at every breakpoint

## How to use
Share:
- The original image concept (describe it or reference a previous generation)
- Target formats and their use cases
- What elements are most important to preserve
- Any platform-specific requirements (safe zones, text overlay areas)

## Example
```
/resize-suite

Original concept: Minimalist flat-lay of premium headphones on a marble surface with soft shadow, warm neutral tones
Target formats:
- 16:9 — Website hero banner
- 1:1 — Instagram feed post
- 9:16 — Instagram/TikTok stories
- 3:2 — LinkedIn post
- 4:3 — Email header
Preserve: Product should remain the clear focal point in all versions
Note: Stories version needs top and bottom safe zones for UI elements
```

## What you'll get
1. **Generated suite** — One image per requested aspect ratio, saved to disk
2. **Composition notes** — How framing and layout adapted for each format
3. **Focal point map** — What's centered and emphasized in each version
4. **Platform recommendations** — Which version works best where, with sizing specs
5. **Consistency check** — Confirmation that brand feel is maintained across the set
