# /mood-board

Create a visual mood board from a brief description.

## What this does
Generates a cohesive set of 4-6 images that establish visual direction for a project. Each image explores a different facet of the mood — color palette, texture, composition, subject matter, lighting — giving you a visual vocabulary to align your team before production.

## When to use
- Starting a new brand or campaign and need to explore visual direction
- Want to align stakeholders on look-and-feel before creating final assets
- Translating a written brief into a visual language
- Building a reference set for a photoshoot or design sprint

## How to use
Share:
- The project or brand context
- Mood keywords (3-5 adjectives that describe the feeling)
- Any visual references or inspiration (describe what you like)
- What the mood board is for (brand identity, campaign, product, editorial)
- Constraints (colors to include/avoid, styles to lean toward/away from)

## Example
```
/mood-board

Project: Rebrand for an artisanal coffee roaster
Mood: Warm, handcrafted, modern rustic, intimate
Inspiration: Think Kinfolk magazine meets Japanese minimalism
Purpose: Establishing visual direction for packaging and website
Constraints: Earth tones only, no stock-photo feel, avoid cluttered compositions
```

## What you'll get
1. **4-6 generated images** — Each exploring a different visual facet of your brief
2. **Visual theme breakdown** — What each image contributes to the overall mood
3. **Color palette extraction** — Dominant colors across the set with hex values
4. **Style vocabulary** — Specific terms to use when briefing designers or generating more assets
5. **Direction recommendation** — Which images to lean into and why, based on your brief
