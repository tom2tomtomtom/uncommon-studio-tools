# /brand-check

Review generated images against loaded brand guidelines.

## What this does
Evaluates generated visual assets against your brand guidelines — checking color palette adherence, style consistency, tone alignment, and technical specs. Flags issues before assets go to clients or production.

## When to use
- Before sharing generated assets with clients or stakeholders
- After generating a batch of images and want quality control
- Checking if visual output matches the brief and brand standards
- Doing a final pass before adding assets to a campaign

## How to use
Share:
- The image(s) to review (reference previous generations or describe them)
- Brand guidelines (colors, typography style, imagery rules, tone)
- What the images are for (context helps evaluate appropriateness)
- Any specific concerns to check

## Example
```
/brand-check

Images: The three hero concepts generated for the "Start Fresh" campaign
Brand guidelines:
- Colors: Forest green (#2D5016), warm white (#FFF8F0), terracotta accent (#C4661F)
- Style: Clean, natural, editorial food photography
- Tone: Approachable and warm, never clinical or intimidating
- Rules: No artificial-looking food, no dark/moody lighting, always show fresh ingredients
Usage: Website hero and Instagram feed
Concern: Want to make sure the food styling feels approachable, not aspirational-chef level
```
