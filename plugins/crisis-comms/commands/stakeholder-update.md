# /stakeholder-update

Draft stakeholder-specific crisis communications.

## What this does
Creates tailored messages for different audiences during a crisis - each written in the right tone with the right information for that group.

## When to use
- Need to communicate the same news to different audiences
- Board, employees, customers all need different messages
- Want consistent core message, adapted appropriately

## How to use
Tell me:
- The situation/news to communicate
- Which stakeholders need updates
- Any specific concerns for each group

## Example
```
/stakeholder-update

We're announcing layoffs affecting 50 employees. Need messages for:
- All employees (email)
- Affected employees (in-person talking points)
- Board (executive summary)
- Media (if they ask)
```

## What you'll get
- **Separate communications** for each stakeholder group
- **Appropriate tone** (empathetic for employees, factual for board, etc.)
- **Consistent core message** across all versions
- **Timing recommendations** on when to send each
