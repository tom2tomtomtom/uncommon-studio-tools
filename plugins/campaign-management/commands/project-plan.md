# /project-plan

Create a comprehensive project plan with timeline.

## What this does
Builds a realistic project plan with phases, milestones, dependencies, and resource needs - ready to share with clients or your team.

## When to use
- Kicking off a new project
- Client asks "what's the timeline?"
- Need to scope a piece of work
- Resource planning

## How to use
Share:
- What the project is
- Key deliverables
- Team available
- Hard deadlines or constraints
- Client approval process (if known)

## Example
```
/project-plan

Project: Website redesign for B2B software company
Deliverables: UX audit, wireframes, visual design (3 concepts), development specs
Team: 1 designer, 1 UX person, 1 PM
Constraint: Must launch before their conference on June 15
Client: 1 week review cycles, CEO final approval
```

1. **Project phases** - Discovery, design, delivery, etc.
2. **Timeline** - Realistic dates with milestones
3. **Deliverables by phase** - What ships when
4. **Dependencies** - What blocks what
5. **Resource allocation** - Who does what, when
6. **Risk flags** - Where timeline is tight
7. **Client checkpoints** - When you need their input
