# /change-impact

Analyze how a change affects your project.

## What this does
When scope, timeline, or resources change, this helps you understand the ripple effects and communicate them clearly to stakeholders.

## When to use
- Client adds scope mid-project
- Timeline gets compressed
- Key team member becomes unavailable
- Need to justify timeline or budget change

## How to use
Share:
- Original plan (or describe it)
- The proposed change
- Constraints that can't flex

## Example
```
/change-impact

Original plan: 3-month brand project, $100k, team of 4
Change: Client wants to add video production (3 short videos)
Constraints: Launch date can't move, budget has some flex
Question: What's the impact and options?
```

## What you'll get
1. **Impact summary** - What this change means in plain terms
