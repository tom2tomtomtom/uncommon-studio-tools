# Part 1: NotebookLM - Your AI Research Assistant

## What is NotebookLM?

NotebookLM is like having a research assistant with a perfect memory. You upload documents, websites, videos, or notes, and it becomes an instant expert on that information. Every answer it gives you is grounded in YOUR sources - not random internet information.

**The Golden Rule:** NotebookLM is only as smart as what you feed it. Quality sources = quality answers.

---

## Understanding the Interface

When you open NotebookLM, you'll see **three main areas**:

```

3. Look for: .edu, .gov, major publications, industry reports
4. Avoid: Random blogs, outdated content, promotional material
5. Save all URLs in a document

### Layer 2: Build Your Knowledge Base
1. Upload all gathered sources to NotebookLM
2. Ask: *"What are the main themes across all my sources?"*
3. Ask: *"What are the key facts and statistics?"*
4. Save these summaries as new notes (Sources → Three dots → Save as note)

### Layer 3: Refine and Discover
1. Ask: *"What did I miss? What questions remain unanswered?"*
2. Ask: *"Compare Source A's findings with Source B's findings"*
3. Look for contradictions, gaps, and opportunities
4. Add new sources to fill gaps, repeat process

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Source failed to process" | File may be too large, corrupted, or password-protected. Try a smaller file or different format. |
| Answers seem wrong | Check which sources are selected (checkboxes). Click citations to verify. |
| Can't find information I know is there | Try rephrasing your question. Use specific terms from the source. |
| Audio Overview won't generate | Some content may violate policies. Try with different sources. |
| Slow responses | Large notebooks take longer. Consider creating focused sub-notebooks. |

## The Iterative Prompting Method

Complex images work better when built step-by-step:

### Round 1: Start Simple
```
A friendly cartoon dinosaur
```
*Result: Basic dinosaur image*

### Round 2: Add Context
```
Now put it in a kitchen wearing an apron
```
*Result: Dinosaur in kitchen with apron*

### Round 3: Add Details
```
Add a chef's hat and a wooden spoon in its hand
```
*Result: Full chef dinosaur setup*

### Round 4: Refine Style
```
Make the style more like a children's book illustration
```
*Result: Polished, stylized final image*

**Why this works better than one long prompt:**
- You can see and fix problems at each stage
- The AI focuses on one thing at a time
- You have more control over the final result

---

## Subject Consistency (Keeping Characters the Same)

This is Nano Banana's superpower - maintaining the same character across different images.

### How It Works:
1. Generate or upload your character image
2. When generating new images, reference the character:
   ```
   The same golden retriever from my previous image,
   now playing at the beach
   ```
3. Nano Banana maintains the character's appearance

### Use Cases:
- **Marketing:** Same product in different settings
- **Storytelling:** Same character in different scenes
- **Branding:** Consistent mascot across materials

---

## Multi-Image Fusion

Combine elements from multiple images into one:

### How to Fuse Images:
1. Upload **Image A** (e.g., a person)
2. Upload **Image B** (e.g., a background)
3. Upload **Image C** (e.g., a style reference)
4. Prompt:
   ```
   Place the person from Image A into the background
   from Image B, using the lighting style of Image C
   ```
5. Nano Banana combines them seamlessly

### Practical Examples:
- **Virtual Try-On:** Your face + clothing item → See how it looks
- **Product Placement:** Your product + lifestyle setting → Marketing image
- **Style Transfer:** Your photo + artistic reference → Styled version

---

## Prompt Writing Best Practices

### Be Specific About Subjects
| Vague (Avoid) | Specific (Better) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "a dog" | "a golden retriever puppy with fluffy fur" |
| "a person" | "a woman in her 30s with short black hair" |
| "a car" | "a vintage red 1965 Mustang convertible" |

### Include These Elements:

1. **Subject:** Who or what is the main focus?
2. **Setting:** Where is this taking place?
3. **Lighting:** What's the light source and quality?
4. **Mood:** What feeling should it evoke?
5. **Style:** Photorealistic? Illustration? Watercolor?
6. **Camera angle:** Close-up? Wide shot? From above?

### Example Complete Prompt:
```
A cozy coffee shop interior (setting) with warm
golden afternoon light streaming through large
windows (lighting). A young woman with curly red
hair (subject) reads a book at a wooden table,
looking peaceful and content (mood). Shot from
a slight angle, medium distance (camera).
Photorealistic style with soft focus on background.
```

| "a dog" | "an energetic border collie with distinctive black and white markings" |

### 2. Action (WHAT'S HAPPENING)
Describe the movement in detail.

| "talking" | "leaning forward intensely, gesturing with both hands" |
| "looking" | "eyes narrowing suspiciously, gaze tracking across the room" |

### 3. Camera Angle (WHERE IS THE CAMERA)

| Term | What It Looks Like | Emotional Effect |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Eye level** | Camera at subject's eye height | Neutral, we're equals |
| **Low angle** | Camera looking UP at subject | Power, dominance, heroic |
| **High angle** | Camera looking DOWN at subject | Vulnerability, smallness |
| **Bird's-eye view** | Directly above, looking straight down | Overview, god-like perspective |
| **Dutch angle** | Camera tilted sideways | Unease, tension, something's wrong |
| **Extreme close-up** | Just eyes, just hands | Intensity, emotion, detail |
| **Wide shot** | Subject small in frame, lots of environment | Context, scale, isolation |
| **Medium shot** | Waist-up | Conversational, standard |
| **Over-the-shoulder** | Behind one person, looking at another | Conversation, connection |

### 4. Camera Movement (HOW DOES IT MOVE)

| Term | What Happens | When to Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Static** | Camera doesn't move | Stability, observation |
| **Pan** | Camera rotates left or right (on tripod) | Reveal, follow action |
| **Tilt** | Camera rotates up or down (on tripod) | Reveal height, show scale |

| **Crane shot** | Camera rises or descends smoothly | Dramatic reveal, scale |
| **Rack focus** | Focus shifts from foreground to background | Direct attention, reveal |
| **Handheld** | Slight shake, documentary feel | Urgency, realism |

### 5. Lighting & Atmosphere

| Term | Visual Effect | Mood Created |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Golden hour** | Warm orange/yellow, soft shadows | Romantic, nostalgic, peaceful |
| **Blue hour** | Cool blue tones, twilight | Contemplative, mysterious |
| **Rembrandt lighting** | Triangle of light on face, dramatic shadows | Artistic, dramatic, serious |
| **Film noir** | High contrast, deep shadows, smoke | Mystery, danger, classic |

## Complete Prompt Examples

### Example 1: Product Commercial
```
Extreme close-up, slow rack focus from foreground to product.
A luxury perfume bottle with geometric crystal design sits on
polished black marble. Soft morning light catches the facets,
creating rainbow reflections. Camera slowly orbits 45 degrees.
High-end commercial style, 4K.
```

### Example 2: Dramatic Scene
```
Low angle, static shot. A silhouetted figure stands at the
edge of a rain-soaked rooftop at night. City lights blur
in the background. Lightning flashes occasionally illuminate
their face - a woman in her 40s with determined expression.
Film noir lighting with blue tones. Cinematic, atmospheric.
```

### Example 3: Social Media Content (Vertical)
```
Medium shot, slight handheld movement. A smiling food blogger
in bright kitchen holds up a perfect chocolate cake. She tilts
it toward camera, revealing layers. Confetti falls in slow motion.
Bright, airy lighting with pastel background. TikTok style,
energetic, 9:16 vertical format.
```

---

## Adding Audio to Your Videos

Veo 3.1 generates matching audio, but you need to guide it:

### For Dialogue:
Use quotation marks for spoken words:
```
A news anchor looks into camera and says "Breaking news
tonight from downtown." Professional studio lighting.
```

**Tips for dialogue:**
- Keep it under 8 seconds of speech
- Simple sentences work better than complex ones
- Spell unusual words phonetically if mispronounced

### For Sound Effects:
Describe the sounds you want:
```
SFX: Thunder rumbles in the distance. Rain patters
against windows. A clock ticks steadily.
```

### For Ambient Sound:
Set the audio atmosphere:
```
Ambient: Busy café sounds - clinking cups, murmured
conversations, espresso machine hissing.
```

---

## Character Consistency Across Videos

Keep the same character in multiple videos:

### Method 1: Reference Images
1. Generate or upload a character image
2. When creating new video, click **"Add reference"**
3. Upload up to 3 reference images
4. Describe your new scene
5. Veo maintains the character's appearance

### Method 2: Detailed Description
Use extremely specific, consistent description every time:
```
The same character: A woman in her 30s, shoulder-length
auburn hair, green eyes, small scar above left eyebrow,
wearing the blue denim jacket from previous scene.
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Vague subjects | AI interprets randomly | Be extremely specific about appearance |
| Too much action | Confused, unrealistic movement | One clear action per clip |
| No camera direction | Random angles/movement | Always specify camera |
| Ignoring lighting | Flat, boring results | Include lighting in every prompt |
| Too long prompts | AI loses track | 100-150 words max |
| Contradictions | AI gets confused | Review prompt for conflicts |

---

# Part 4: Runway - Fast & Flexible Video

## What is Runway?

Runway (Gen-4) is a video AI tool focused on speed and creative control. It's less about perfect realism and more about getting things done quickly with the ability to fine-tune results.

**Key difference from Veo 3:**
- Veo 3 = Maximum realism, less control
- Runway = More control, faster iteration

**Important:** Runway ALWAYS requires an image to start. You cannot generate video from text only.

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your First Video

### Step 1: Create a Session
1. Go to **runwayml.com** and log in
2. Click **"Sessions"** in the left menu
3. Click **"New Session"** button
4. Give your session a name

### Step 2: Upload Your Starting Image
**Critical:** You MUST upload an image first. Runway cannot generate from text only.

1. Click **"Upload"** or drag an image into the preview area
2. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
3. Higher quality images = better results

**Where to get starting images:**
- Generate with Nano Banana first

## Using Audio Tags (Eleven v3)

Control emotion and expression with simple tags in your text:

### Available Tags:
```
[whispers] This is a secret... [/whispers]
[sighs] I can't believe it happened again.
[laughs] That's hilarious!
[excited] And the winner is... YOU!
[serious] This is very important information.
[pause] ... (creates a brief silence)
```

### Example Script with Tags:
```
[excited] Welcome to the show, everyone! [pause]
Today we have an incredible announcement.
[whispers] But first, let me tell you a secret...
[normal voice] Our new product launches tomorrow!
[laughs] I can barely contain myself!
```

### Pronunciation Tips:
- **Emphasis:** Write in ALL CAPS: "This is VERY important"
- **Pauses:** Use "..." for longer pauses: "And the winner is... Sarah!"
- **Numbers:** Spell out: "three hundred" not "300"
- **Difficult words:** Spell phonetically: "Nguyen" → "Win"
- **Acronyms:** Add periods: "C.E.O." not "CEO"

# Part 7: n8n - Workflow Automation (Detailed Guide)

## What is n8n?

n8n connects your apps and automates repetitive tasks. When something happens in one app, n8n can automatically trigger actions in other apps.

**Example:** New email arrives → Extract info → Add to spreadsheet → Send Slack notification → Create task in Asana

---

## Understanding the Core Concepts

### What is a Workflow?
A workflow is a series of automated steps. Think of it like a recipe:
1. **Trigger:** What starts the recipe (timer goes off, ingredient arrives)
2. **Steps:** What you do (chop, mix, cook)
3. **Output:** The final result (finished dish)

### What is a Node?
A node is ONE step in your workflow. Each node does ONE thing:
- Get emails
- Send a message
- Transform data
- Make a decision

### What is a Trigger?
A trigger is a special node that STARTS your workflow. Something has to kick things off:
- **Schedule:** "Every Monday at 9am"
- **Webhook:** "When this URL receives data"
- **Event:** "When a new email arrives"
- **Manual:** "When I click Execute"

| **Email Trigger (IMAP)** | When email arrives | Auto-process incoming mail |
| **Slack Trigger** | When Slack event occurs | Respond to messages |
| **Google Sheets Trigger** | When row added/changed | Spreadsheet automation |
| **Manual Trigger** | When you click Execute | Testing, on-demand tasks |

### Action Nodes (Do things)

| Category | Examples | What They Do |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Communication** | Slack, Email, Discord, Telegram | Send messages |
| **Data** | Google Sheets, Airtable, Notion | Read/write databases |

## The 10 Golden Rules for n8n

### Rule 1: Name Everything Immediately
Right-click every node and give it a clear name.

**Bad:** `Gmail1`, `HTTP Request3`, `IF`
**Good:** `Get Unread Emails`, `Fetch Customer Data`, `Check If VIP`

**Why:** Three months from now, you won't remember what "HTTP Request7" does.

### Rule 2: Test One Item First
When building, use **"Execute Node"** instead of running the full workflow.

**How:** Click on a node → Click "Execute node" in the panel

**Why:** Prevents accidentally sending 500 emails or making 500 API calls.

### Rule 3: Use the Limit Node for Testing
When your workflow processes multiple items:

1. Add a **"Limit"** node after your data source
2. Set it to process only 2-3 items
3. Test your full workflow with small data
4. Remove or disable the Limit node when going live

### Rule 4: Always Build Error Handling

**Method 1: Error Workflow**
1. Create a new workflow
2. Start it with **"Error Trigger"** node
3. Add notification (Slack, email)
4. In your main workflow → Settings → Error Workflow → Select your error workflow

**Method 2: Error Branch**
1. Click any node
2. Find **"On Error"** setting
3. Choose **"Continue"** and add error handling path

### Rule 5: Add Wait Nodes for APIs
APIs limit how many requests you can make per minute.

**Add Wait nodes between API calls:**
1. Add **"Wait"** node after API call
2. Set delay (start with 1-2 seconds)
3. Prevents "Rate Limit Exceeded" errors

### Rule 6: Never Hardcode Credentials
**Never do this:**
```
API Key: sk-12345abcde
Password: mysecretpassword
```

**Always do this:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Credentials**
2. Create credential for each service
3. Reference credentials in nodes
4. Or use environment variables

### Rule 7: Use Project-Level Variables
For values you use in multiple places:

1. **Settings** → **Variables**
2. Create variable: `{{$vars.api_base_url}}`
3. Use in nodes: `{{ $vars.api_base_url }}/endpoint`
4. Change once, updates everywhere

### Rule 8: Check Data Structure at Each Step
The #1 cause of errors is mismatched data structure.

**After every node that transforms data:**
1. Click the node
2. Look at **Output** tab
3. Make sure the data is structured how the next node expects

### Rule 9: Use Expressions for Dynamic Data
Don't hardcode values that should change:

**Static (bad):** `Hello, John!`
**Dynamic (good):** `Hello, {{ $json.firstName }}!`

**Common expressions:**
- `{{ $json.fieldName }}` - Access field from previous node
- `{{ $now }}` - Current timestamp
- `{{ $('Node Name').item.json.field }}` - Access specific node's output

### Rule 10: Document with Sticky Notes
Add sticky notes to explain complex parts:

1. Right-click canvas → **Add Sticky Note**
2. Explain what this section does
3. Document any non-obvious logic
4. Future you will thank present you

## Common n8n Errors and Solutions

### Error: "Node execution failed"
**Cause:** The node couldn't complete its task

**Solutions:**
1. Check credentials are valid
2. Check API is online
3. Check data format matches node requirements
4. Look at error details (expand the error message)

### Error: "Referenced node is unexecuted"
**Cause:** You're trying to use data from a node that hasn't run yet

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure all required nodes are connected
2. Make sure the referenced node is upstream (earlier) in the flow
3. Run the full workflow, not just one node

### Error: "ETIMEDOUT" or connection errors
**Cause:** Couldn't connect to external service

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Check if the service is online
3. Check firewall/security settings
4. Try increasing timeout in node settings

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded" (HTTP 429)
**Cause:** Too many API requests too quickly

**Solutions:**
1. Add **Wait** nodes between requests
2. Use **Batch** settings: Set "Items per Batch" to 10-50
3. Enable "Retry on Fail" with increasing delays

### Error: Data format issues
**Cause:** Output structure doesn't match input requirements

**Solutions:**
1. Add a **Set** node to restructure data
2. Use **Code** node for complex transformations
3. Check both nodes' input/output tabs to compare structures

## Real-World Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Daily Email Summary to Slack

**What it does:** Every morning, summarize unread emails and post to Slack

```
[Schedule Trigger] → [Gmail: Get Messages] → [OpenAI: Summarize] → [Slack: Send]
     "9am"           "unread only"           "brief summary"      "#daily-digest"
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. Schedule Trigger → 9:00 AM every weekday
2. Gmail → Get up to 20 unread messages
3. OpenAI → "Summarize these emails in 3 bullet points each"
4. Slack → Post to #daily-digest channel

### Example 2: Form to CRM with Notification

**What it does:** When someone fills out a form, add to CRM and notify sales

```
[Webhook] → [HubSpot: Create Contact] → [Slack: Send] → [Gmail: Send Welcome]
  "form"     "new lead"                  "#sales"       "thank you email"
```

### Example 3: Content Repurposing Pipeline

**What it does:** When you add an article URL, create social posts

```
[Airtable Trigger] → [HTTP: Fetch Article] → [OpenAI: Create Posts] → [Airtable: Save]
   "new row"           "get content"          "Twitter, LinkedIn"     "add to social queue"
```

## Using the AI Workflow Builder

n8n 2.0 includes AI to help build workflows:

### How to Use:
1. Click **"New Workflow"**
2. Click **"Build with AI"** button (or just describe in chat)
3. Type what you want in plain English:
   ```
   When I receive an email from a VIP client
   (anyone @bigcompany.com), send me a Slack DM
   and create a high-priority task in Asana
   ```
4. n8n creates the workflow structure
5. Review the generated nodes
6. Fill in credentials and test
7. Activate when ready

**The AI is a starting point** - you still need to:
- Connect your accounts (credentials)
- Test with real data
- Fine-tune any logic

---

## Data Tables (Built-in Database)

n8n 2.0 includes built-in data storage:

### Use Cases:
- Store VIP customer list
- Track processed items (avoid duplicates)
- Save state between workflow runs
- Store configuration data

### How to Use:
1. Search for **"n8n Data"** node
2. Operations available:
   - **Create** - Add new record
   - **Read** - Get records
   - **Update** - Modify existing
   - **Delete** - Remove record
3. Data persists between workflow runs
