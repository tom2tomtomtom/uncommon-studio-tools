Craft a compelling pitch email for journalists.

## What this does
Creates a personalized, attention-grabbing pitch that journalists actually want to open. Includes subject line, email body, and follow-up strategy.

## When to use
- Pitching a story to specific journalists

## How to use
Share:
- What's the story/angle?
- Who's the target journalist or outlet?
- Why should they care right now?
- What can you offer them? (exclusive, interview, data, etc.)
