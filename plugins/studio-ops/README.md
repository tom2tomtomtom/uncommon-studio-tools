## 💡 Tips

- **Be detailed about current state** - The more Claude knows about how things work now, the better the documentation
- **Include pain points** - Tell Claude what's broken so recommendations address real problems
- **Think about the audience** - Specify who will use the document (new hire, senior leader, whole team)

## 🔌 Optional Connectors

These let Claude access your tools directly (not required):
- **Slack** - Share processes and updates with your team
- **Notion** - Store SOPs and onboarding documentation
- **Google Drive** - Access existing templates and documents

Set these up in **Settings → Connectors** if you want them.
