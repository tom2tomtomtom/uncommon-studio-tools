# /process-doc

Document a process or create an SOP.

## What this does
Creates clear, step-by-step process documentation that anyone can follow, with decision points, exceptions, and ownership clearly defined.

## When to use
- Documenting a process that only lives in someone's head
- Standardizing a workflow that varies by person
- Preparing for team changes or scaling
- Audit or compliance documentation needs

## How to use
Share:
- Process name and purpose
- Current steps (even if rough)
- Who's involved and their roles
- Tools used in the process
- Common problems or exceptions
- Who the documentation is for

## Example
```
/process-doc

Process: Client brief intake and distribution
Current state: Client sends brief via email, account lead reads it,
forwards to relevant teams. Sometimes things get missed.
People involved: Account Director, Creative Director, Strategist, PM
Tools: Email, Slack, Monday.com
Problem: Briefs sometimes reach teams late or incomplete
Audience: Account management team
```

## What you'll get
1. **Process overview** - Purpose, scope, and owner
2. **Step-by-step workflow** - Numbered steps with decision points
3. **RACI matrix** - Who's responsible, accountable, consulted, informed
4. **Exception handling** - What to do when things go wrong
5. **Review schedule** - When to update the documentation
