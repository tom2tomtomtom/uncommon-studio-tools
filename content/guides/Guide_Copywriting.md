## Claude: Key Features for Copywriting

### Projects — Per Client Brand Voice

Set up a Project for each client. Upload their tone of voice guide, brand guidelines, approved copy examples, and any style references. The custom instructions should embed the brand voice so every output is on-brand from the start.

**Example custom instructions:**

> You are a senior copywriter working on [brand]. Their tone of voice is [describe — e.g. "confident but never arrogant, warm but not saccharine, clever but not trying too hard"]. The full tone of voice guide is uploaded — always reference it. When writing copy, match their existing voice — don't invent a new one. When I share draft copy, give me honest feedback on whether it sounds like this brand or like generic advertising.

**Why this matters:** Without a Project and custom instructions, Claude writes in a generic "AI voice." With the brand context loaded, it produces copy that's already in the right territory, saving you rounds of revision.

### Headline and Tagline Exploration

Don't ask Claude for "the perfect headline." Ask it for volume and range, then use your judgement to pick and refine.

> Give me 20 headline options for [describe the ad/piece]. I want range — some short and punchy, some longer and more narrative, some that lead with the benefit, some that lead with the tension. Don't play it safe.

> Here's my working headline: [paste]. Give me 10 variations that keep the same strategic idea but try different tonal registers, structures, and word choices.

> I need a tagline for [brand/campaign]. The strategic territory is [describe]. Give me 15 options across a spectrum: from functional to emotional, from understated to bold. Then tell me which three you think are strongest and why.

### Tonal Exploration and Voice Development

Claude is excellent at showing you what different tonal choices feel like in practice.

> Write the same piece of body copy in five different tones: authoritative, conversational, provocative, poetic, and deadpan. The product is [describe] and the message is [describe]. I want to see how tone changes the meaning.

> Here are three brands whose tone of voice I admire: [list them]. Analyse what makes each voice distinctive. What are the specific linguistic choices — sentence length, vocabulary level, use of humour, punctuation style — that create their tone?

> We're developing a tone of voice for a new brand. The brand is [describe]. Write the same 100-word brand manifesto in three completely different voices. Then articulate the rules of each voice — what it does and doesn't do.

### Long-Form Copy Research

When you're writing long-form content (articles, manifestos, case studies, thought leadership), use Claude to research the subject before you write.

> I'm writing a long-form article about [topic] for [brand/publication]. Research the topic and give me: the key facts and data I should reference, the most interesting angle that hasn't been overdone, three potential structural approaches for the piece, and any quotes or perspectives from experts in this space.

> I'm writing a case study about [project]. Here's the brief and the results: [paste]. Help me find the narrative — what's the most compelling story structure for this case study? What should the headline be? What details matter and what's filler?

### Pressure-Testing and Editing

Use Claude as a ruthless editor.

> Here's my draft: [paste]. Edit it for: clarity (is every sentence earning its place?), rhythm (does it flow or does it plod?), brand voice (does it sound like [brand]?), and impact (does the opening hook and does the ending land?). Show me the edited version and explain what you changed and why.

> Read this copy and tell me where you'd cut. I need to lose 30% of the word count without losing the core message or the voice.

> Is this headline distinctive or is it something any brand in [category] could say? Be honest. If it's generic, tell me what's missing.

### Breaking Creative Blocks

When you're stuck, use Claude to generate raw material you can work with.

> I'm stuck on [describe the piece]. I know the message is [describe] and the tone should be [describe], but I can't find the entry point. Give me 10 completely different opening lines — some conventional, some weird. I'm trying to find the thread.

> Give me 20 metaphors or analogies for [concept]. Go wide — pull from nature, sport, cooking, engineering, music, whatever. I need fresh language for a concept that's been described the same way too many times.

## NotebookLM: Key Features for Copywriting

### Brand Voice Reference Library

Upload the tone of voice guide, approved copy examples (ads, social posts, website copy, packaging), and any competitor copy you want to contrast against.

> Based on the approved copy examples in this notebook, what are the consistent patterns in this brand's voice? What sentence structures, word choices, and punctuation habits define the tone?

> I've written this line: [paste]. Based on the brand's tone of voice guide and approved examples, is this on-brand? What would need to change?

### Research Synthesis for Long-Form

When writing about a subject, upload the relevant research and source material to NotebookLM.

> Summarise the key data points and insights from these sources that are most relevant for a consumer-facing article about [topic]. Cite the source for each.

> Pull out any direct quotes from interviews or reports that I could use or reference in the piece.

### Audio Overviews for Brief Absorption

Generate an Audio Overview from a creative brief and supporting strategy docs. Listen to it before you start writing — hearing the brief discussed conversationally can surface the creative entry point faster than reading it silently.
