## Claude: Key Features for Creative

### Projects — Your Creative Workspace

Set up a Claude Project for each campaign or pitch. Upload the creative brief, brand guidelines, tone of voice documents, and any reference material. Write custom instructions that tell Claude how to behave.

**Example custom instructions:**

> You are a creative thinking partner at an advertising agency. You're working on a campaign for [brand]. The creative brief is uploaded — always reference it when developing ideas. When brainstorming, go for unexpected and distinctive ideas, not safe ones. Push beyond the first obvious thought. When I share work, give honest feedback — tell me what's strong and what's generic. Never suggest ideas that feel like they could be for any brand.

### Using Claude for Concept Development

The biggest mistake creatives make with AI is asking it to "come up with ideas." That produces generic output. Instead, use Claude to expand, challenge, and build on your own thinking.

**Prompts that work:**

Lateral inspiration:
> I'm working on a campaign for [brand] about [theme]. Give me 10 unexpected reference points from outside advertising — from art, science, music, architecture, subcultures, or history — that connect to this theme in surprising ways. For each, explain the connection and how it could inspire a creative execution.

Concept pressure-testing:
> Here's our campaign concept: [describe it]. Be brutally honest. Is this distinctive or could any brand in this category run it? What makes it ownable? Where is it weakest? How would you push it further?

Script and copy exploration:
> I'm writing a 30-second script for [brand]. The tone is [describe]. Here's my current draft: [paste]. Give me three alternative versions — one that's more stripped back, one that's more emotionally intense, and one that takes a completely different structural approach.

Tonal range-finding:
> Show me what this headline looks like at five different tonal registers: deadpan, warm, provocative, poetic, and absurdist. The product is [describe] and the audience is [describe].

Expanding a territory:
> We've landed on the creative territory of [describe]. Now help me think about executions across channels. What does this look like as a 60-second film? A social-first campaign? An experiential activation? An OOH series? Don't just describe them — give me the specific creative hook for each.

### Using Claude for Reference and Cultural Research

Turn on **Web Search** and use Claude to find cultural references, campaign precedents, and creative inspiration.

> Find me examples of brands that have used [specific technique — e.g. "user-generated content as the hero of TV advertising"]. I want both well-known examples and lesser-known ones. For each, explain what made it work.

> What are the most interesting creative campaigns globally in the [category] space over the last 12 months? Focus on work that did something genuinely new, not just well-executed versions of familiar approaches.

### Research Mode for Creative Context

Use Research mode when you need deeper cultural context for a creative brief.

> Research the cultural meaning of [theme/topic] in Australia right now. How is it showing up in popular culture, social media, and public conversation? What are the tensions and contradictions? I need this to inform a creative brief, so focus on insights that could spark interesting creative work.

## NotebookLM: Key Features for Creative

### Synthesising Briefs and Reference Material

Upload creative briefs, strategy decks, brand guidelines, and research reports. Ask NotebookLM to pull out the key creative springboards.

> Based on all my sources, what are the three strongest consumer insights that could fuel a creative campaign? Quote the specific language from each source.

> What tensions or contradictions emerge across these documents? I'm looking for friction points that could become interesting creative territory.

### Audio Overviews for Creative Briefings

Generate an Audio Overview from the brief and strategy deck. Share it with the creative team as a 5-minute audio briefing — it's faster than a written brief for getting everyone aligned on the territory.

### Building a Reference Notebook

Create a notebook specifically for creative references — paste in URLs of campaigns you admire, upload case study PDFs, add YouTube links to film references. Then use NotebookLM to find patterns.

> What common approaches do the campaigns in my reference collection share? What's the most frequently used structural technique? Which references feel the most distinctive and why?
