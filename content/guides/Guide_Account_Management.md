## Claude: Key Features for Account Management

### Projects — One Per Client

Create a Claude Project for each key client. Upload brand guidelines, the current scope of work, recent briefs, and any key reference documents. Write custom instructions that give Claude the client context.

**Example custom instructions:**

> You are an account management assistant at an advertising agency. The client is [brand name] in the [category]. Key contacts are [names/roles]. The current project is [describe]. When drafting client communications, use a tone that is professional, warm, and confident — never overly formal or stiff. Always anticipate client concerns and address them proactively.

### Meeting Preparation

Before any client meeting, ask Claude to help you prepare.

> I have a meeting with [client] tomorrow to discuss [topic]. Based on what you know about this project, draft me: a suggested agenda (keep it tight — 30 minutes), three key points I need to raise, two potential concerns the client might have and how I should address them, and any open actions I should follow up on.

> Research the latest news about [client's company/industry] in the last two weeks. I want to walk into this meeting informed about anything that might affect our work or that I should reference in conversation.

### Client Communications

Claude is excellent at drafting emails, status updates, and recap notes that hit the right tone.

**Status update:**
> Draft a weekly status email for [client]. The update should cover: [list current workstreams and their status]. Keep the tone upbeat but honest — flag the timeline risk on [workstream] without making it sound alarming. End with next steps and any decisions we need from them.

**Difficult conversation prep:**
> I need to tell [client] that [the timeline has slipped / budget needs to increase / the creative direction needs to change]. Draft an email that explains the situation clearly, takes accountability where appropriate, presents a solution, and maintains their confidence in us.

**Meeting recap:**
> Here are my rough meeting notes: [paste]. Turn these into a clean recap email with: key decisions made, action items with owners and deadlines, and any open questions that need follow-up. Keep it scannable — the client should be able to read it in under a minute.

### Industry Awareness

Use **Web Search** or **Research mode** to stay across your clients' industries without hours of reading.

> Give me a 5-minute briefing on what's happened in the [industry] space in Australia over the last month. Focus on competitor activity, market news, and anything that could affect [client's brand].

> Research what [client's main competitor] has been doing in market over the last quarter. Any new campaigns, product launches, or strategic shifts I should be aware of?

## NotebookLM: Key Features for Account Management

### The Client Knowledge Base

Create a notebook for each major client. Upload everything: brand guidelines, SOWs, meeting notes, briefs, research, contracts. This becomes your searchable client brain.

> When was the last time we discussed [topic] with the client? What was agreed?

> What does the brand guidelines document say about the use of [specific element — logo, tagline, colour]?

> Pull out all the KPIs and success metrics mentioned across our project briefs for this client.

### Audio Overviews for Onboarding

When a new team member joins an account, generate an Audio Overview from the key client documents. It's faster than a written handover and covers the essentials.

### Pre-Meeting Source Checks

Before a meeting, ask NotebookLM to surface the relevant context from your uploaded documents.

> Based on my sources, summarise everything we know about [upcoming project/workstream]. Include any constraints, deadlines, or client preferences that were mentioned.
