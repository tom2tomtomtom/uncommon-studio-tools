## Claude: Key Features for Digital

### Projects — Per Client or Per Channel

Set up Projects with key digital assets: media plans, analytics exports, platform specs, audience data, past performance reports. Write instructions that tell Claude your digital context.

**Example custom instructions:**

> You are a digital strategy and analytics specialist at an advertising agency. The client is [brand]. When analysing data, always provide actionable recommendations — not just observations. Distinguish between correlation and causation. When discussing platform strategy, account for the Australian market specifically (audience sizes, platform penetration, cost benchmarks). Present findings in a format suitable for client reporting.

### Interpreting Analytics and Performance Data

Paste analytics data directly into Claude — it can process tables, CSVs, and even screenshots of dashboards.

> Here's our monthly performance data for [client]: [paste data]. Analyse the key trends. What's performing above/below benchmark? What's driving the changes? Give me three specific optimisation recommendations with expected impact.

> Compare these two campaign periods: [paste data for both]. What changed and why? Factor in seasonality, creative rotation, and any platform algorithm changes that might explain the shifts.

> Here's our Google Analytics data for [client's website] over the last quarter: [paste]. What's the most important story in this data? What should we tell the client, and what should we do differently next quarter?

### Platform Research and Trends

Use **Research mode** to stay across the fast-moving digital landscape.

> Research the latest algorithm changes and best practices for [platform — TikTok, Meta, LinkedIn, YouTube] advertising in 2026. What's changed in the last 3 months that affects how we should be running campaigns?

> What are the current benchmark CPMs, CPCs, and engagement rates for [platform] advertising in Australia across [category]? How do these compare to 6 months ago?

> Research emerging ad formats and placements on [platform]. What's new, what's in beta, and what should we be testing for our clients?

### Digital Strategy Development

> Build a channel strategy for [brand] targeting [audience] with a budget of [amount] over [timeframe]. Recommend the channel mix, budget split rationale, KPIs for each channel, and key creative considerations per platform.

> We're seeing declining performance on [channel] for [client]. Research potential causes and give me a diagnostic framework — what should we test first, second, third to identify and fix the issue?

### SEO and Content Strategy

> Conduct a topical analysis for [brand's website]. Based on their category and competitors, what content gaps exist? What topics should they be creating content around to improve organic visibility?

> Research the current state of SEO best practice for [specific area — e.g. AI overviews, video SEO, local search]. What's changed recently and how should we adapt our approach?

### Technical Brief Writing

> Write a technical brief for [describe project — e.g. a landing page build, a tracking implementation, an API integration]. Include: objectives, technical requirements, platform specifications, acceptance criteria, and QA checklist.
