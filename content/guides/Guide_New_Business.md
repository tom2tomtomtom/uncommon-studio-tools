## Claude: Key Features for New Business

### Projects — Per Pitch or Per Prospect

Create a Project for each active pitch. Upload the RFP or brief, any publicly available information about the prospect, the competitive context, and relevant case studies. Write instructions that focus Claude on winning.

**Example custom instructions:**

> You are a new business strategist at an Australian advertising agency. We're pitching for [brand/company]. The RFP is uploaded. When developing pitch content, always connect our capabilities directly to what the client has asked for — don't lead with what we want to say, lead with what they need to hear. Our key differentiators are [list them]. Our tone in credentials and proposals is confident, specific, and human — never corporate jargon.

### Prospect Intelligence

Use **Research mode** to build a thorough picture of a prospect before you meet them or start writing a proposal.

> Research [company name] comprehensively. I need to understand: their business model and revenue streams, their current marketing and advertising approach, their brand positioning and key messages, recent news and strategic moves, their leadership team (CMO and marketing decision-makers), and any public challenges or opportunities they're facing.

> Research [company]'s current agency relationships. Who do they work with? What's the scope? Have there been any recent account reviews or changes? Are there any signals about what they're looking for in a new agency partner?

> Analyse [company]'s public brand presence — website, social media, advertising, content. What are they doing well? Where are the gaps or inconsistencies? What would we immediately want to fix or improve?

### RFP and Brief Analysis

Upload the RFP to your Project, then use Claude to break it down.

> Analyse this RFP in detail. What are the stated evaluation criteria and how should we weight our response? What are they really asking for beneath the formal language? What are the non-obvious requirements — the things that aren't stated but would differentiate a winning response? What questions should we ask in the briefing session?

> Based on this RFP, identify the three biggest opportunities for us to stand out. Where can we show distinctive thinking rather than standard agency capabilities?

> Map our agency's strengths and case studies against each requirement in this RFP. Where are we strong? Where do we have gaps we need to address creatively?

### Proposal and Credential Writing

> Draft the executive summary for our pitch to [client]. The key message is [describe]. Keep it to one page. It should demonstrate that we understand their challenge, articulate why we're the right partner, and give them a reason to keep reading.

> Write a case study summary for [project name]. The client was [name], the challenge was [describe], what we did was [describe], and the results were [describe]. Write it in a format suitable for a credentials deck — punchy, results-focused, and structured as Challenge / Approach / Results.

> We need to articulate our agency's approach to [specific capability — e.g. social strategy, data-driven creative, integrated campaigns]. Write a half-page capability statement that's specific to what [prospect] is looking for. Avoid generic agency language.

### Competitive Pitch Intelligence

> Research the other agencies likely to be pitching for this account. Based on the brief and the category, who would typically be on a shortlist? What are their strengths and likely pitch angles? How do we differentiate against them?

## NotebookLM: Key Features for New Business

### The Case Study and Credentials Library

Upload all past proposals, case studies, credential decks, and capability statements. This becomes your searchable new business archive.

> Do we have any case studies that demonstrate experience in [category/capability]? Summarise the most relevant ones.

> Find examples from our past proposals where we addressed [specific challenge — e.g. reaching Gen Z audiences, driving retail footfall, brand repositioning].

> What have we said about our [specific capability] in past pitches? Pull together the strongest articulations across all our proposals.

### RFP Source Analysis

Upload the RFP and any supporting documents from the prospect. Use NotebookLM to extract specific requirements and deadlines.

> Create a checklist of every requirement and deliverable mentioned in this RFP, with the relevant deadline for each.

> What evaluation criteria does the RFP specify? Are there any weighting percentages mentioned?

### Audio Overviews for Pitch Team Briefings

Generate an Audio Overview from the RFP and prospect research. Share it with the pitch team to get everyone aligned before the first working session.
