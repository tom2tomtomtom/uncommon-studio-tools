## How These Tools Help Designers

**Claude** helps with design research, trend analysis, accessibility checking, and translating briefs into design direction. It can articulate design rationale, suggest layout approaches, and help you think through visual systems. It won't replace your design tools, but it speeds up the thinking that happens before you open Figma.

**NotebookLM** helps you organise brand guidelines, style guides, and design references into a searchable library. Ask it questions about brand standards instead of flipping through a 60-page PDF.

## Claude: Key Features for Design

### Projects — Per Client or Per Brand System

Set up Projects with brand guidelines, style guides, and design system documentation uploaded. Claude can then reference these when helping you think through design decisions.

**Example custom instructions:**

> You are a design thinking partner. The client is [brand]. Their brand guidelines and design system are uploaded. When discussing design decisions, always reference the brand system. Be specific about typography, colour, spacing, and hierarchy rather than vague. When suggesting approaches, explain the design reasoning — not just what to do, but why it works.

### Design Research and Trend Analysis

Use **Research mode** for deep design trend exploration.

> Research the current visual trends in [category — e.g. wellness, fintech, luxury fashion] branding globally. Focus on typography choices, colour palettes, photography style, and layout approaches. I want to understand what the category convention is so I can decide whether to follow or break it.

> What are the most significant shifts in digital design (web and app) over the last 12 months? Focus on interaction patterns, layout trends, and emerging UI conventions. Include specific brand examples.

> Research how brands are approaching [specific design challenge — e.g. dark mode, accessibility, motion design, variable fonts] right now. Show me who's doing it well and what the best practice looks like.

### Translating Briefs into Design Direction

When you receive a creative or design brief, use Claude to help translate strategic language into visual direction.

> Here's the creative brief: [paste or reference uploaded doc]. The strategic territory is [describe]. Help me translate this into a visual direction. What should the design feel like? What typographic choices, colour palette approach, photography/illustration style, and layout principles would best express this strategy? Give me specific references.

> The brand tone is described as "[e.g. confident but approachable, premium but not pretentious]." What does that mean visually? How does "confident but approachable" translate into typography, colour weight, whitespace, and image treatment?

### Accessibility and Usability Checks

Claude can help you think through accessibility before you get to testing.

> Review this colour combination: [hex codes] as text on background. Does it meet WCAG AA contrast requirements? If not, suggest the closest compliant alternatives that maintain the same feel.

> I'm designing a form with [describe fields and layout]. Walk me through potential accessibility issues — tab order, label placement, error states, screen reader considerations. What am I likely to miss?

### Articulating Design Rationale

When you need to present or defend design decisions to clients or creative directors, Claude can help you articulate the "why."

> I've made these design choices for [project]: [describe key decisions — type choice, layout approach, colour palette, image treatment]. Help me articulate the design rationale for each. Why do these choices work for this brand and this brief? Write it in a way I can present in a client meeting.

## NotebookLM: Key Features for Design

### Brand Guidelines as a Searchable Database

Upload all brand guidelines, style guides, and design system documentation to a client notebook. Then query it instead of scrolling through PDFs.

> What are the approved secondary colour combinations for [brand]? What does the guideline say about using colour overlays on photography?

> What's the minimum clear space around the logo? Are there specific rules for logo placement on dark backgrounds?

> Summarise all the typography rules — primary and secondary typefaces, sizing hierarchy, and any restrictions on usage.

### Design Reference Organisation

Upload reference materials — case studies, design award entries, design articles — and use NotebookLM to find patterns.

> What common design approaches do the references in this notebook share? Are there patterns in typography, colour, or layout that keep recurring?

### Data Tables for Design Specs

Use the Data Tables feature to extract structured design specifications from guidelines.

> Create a table of all the colour specifications in the brand guidelines: colour name, hex code, RGB value, Pantone reference, and approved usage.

## Demo Examples for Design

1. **Brief translation:** Paste a creative brief → ask Claude to translate the strategic territory into a visual direction with specific design recommendations
2. **Trend research:** Use Research mode to explore current visual trends in a specific category
3. **Guidelines query:** Show NotebookLM with brand guidelines uploaded → ask a specific question about logo usage or colour specifications
4. **Design rationale:** Describe a design decision → ask Claude to help articulate the reasoning for a client presentation
